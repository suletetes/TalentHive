Freelance Management System 
Abstract: 
          Freelance job is where you’re a temporary contract worker, rather than a permanent 
employee. Depending on your level of expertise, it could be possible to work part-time hours, 
but make full-time pay. Having control over your work load, the clients you work with, and 
your income is a big benefit of freelancing. Freelancing is doing a job under contract rather 
than full employment. Usually, people who freelance are selfemployed and for whom they 
will work and they decide for how long. Freelancing offers the lot of freedom and flexibility 
which regular jobs cannot. The freelancer can choose the type of the work, time of the day 
can work and how long they work, a location they work and volume of work take on. The 
freelancer can control work relationship and control work load. Platform freelancing has 
many websites and anyone can register as freelancers or job posters. There is a discussion 
forum to build up friendly environment between freelancers and clients. All they can work 
without any language issue. For these solutions, the system is designed according to four sub 
modules such as user validation module, file sharing module and manage profile. Users of the 
system are Job poster, Freelancer (Jobseeker). Inputs of the system are Details of the Job 
poster, Freelancer, Job, gig. Outputs of the system are Overall rating. Processes of the system 
are collected data, analyze data and job posting, creating gigs, discussion and complete the 
job. It is distributed among 20 selected users and collects their feedback. Keywords - 
Freelancing, Freelancer.

Introduction 
 
Introduction: 
 A freelancer is a self-employed person who offers services to clients. These services 
often, though not necessarily, are offered to businesses through the proliferation of sharing 
economy platforms like Task Rabbit, Mechanical Turk, or Up work. However, individuals 
can offer their services directly to clients, without third-party resources that often take a cut 
of the pay. Freelancing is flexible. You can often work full- or part-time on projects of your 
choice, at the hours that are convenient for you. Although clients can (and usually will) set 
specifications for the work they want to be done, a freelancer is still an independent 
contractor, not an employee. You'd be free to control how the work is completed. However, if 
your clients don't like the final product, you might find yourself out of a gig. Freelancing 
allows you to set your own price for your services, which is often higher than what you'd 
make as an employee doing the same work. Make sure you charge enough to cover your 
overhead and to compensate you fairly for the time it will take you to do the work. You'll 
probably want to take on any client who will hire you when you're starting out, but you also 
have the option to not take on difficult clients, especially as you grow. You can even tell 
clients you no longer wish to work for them. 
Nearly every type of service needed by a business can be provided by a freelancer. Some of 
the most common freelance opportunities include: 
 Project Management  
 Web Design/Development  
 Software developer 
 Writing / Editing 
 Graphic Design  
 
 
 
 
 
 
System Analysis 
 Existing System: 
The existing system is a semi-automated at where the information is stored in the form of 
excel sheets in disk drives. The information sharing to the Volunteers, Group members, etc. is 
through mailing feature only. The information storage and maintenance is more critical in this 
system. Tracking the member‘s activities and progress of the work is a tedious job here. This 
system cannot provide the information sharing by 24x7 days. 
Disadvantages Of Existing System 
 
 More manpower. 
 Time consuming. 
 Consumes large volume of pare work. 
 Needs manual calculations. 
 No direct role for the higher officials. 
To avoid all these limitations and make the working more accurately the system to be 
computerized 
. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Proposed System: 
 
 The development of this new system objective is to provide the solution to the 
problems of existing system. By using this new system, we can fully automate the 
entire process of the current system. The new system would like to make as web
enabled so that the information can be shared between the members at any time using 
the respective credentials. To track the status of an individual process, the status 
update can be centralized using the new system. Being a web-enabled system, the 
process can be accessed across the world over net. 
 
 This system also providing the features like , Mailing between the members; updating 
the process status in centralized location; generated reports can also be exporting to 
the applications like MS-Excel, PDF format, etc. In this new system, the members 
like Donors can give their valuable feedback to the Volunteers so that the Volunteers 
can check their progress of the tasks.  
 
 The entire process categorized as different modules like Admin module, Volunteer 
module, etc. at where we can classify the functionality as an individual process. 
 
 
 Using the new system entering into Admin module we can perform…. 
 
 
Advantages of Proposed System 
 
 Ensure data accuracy. 
 Proper control of the higher officials. 
 Reduce the damages of the machines. 
 Minimize manual data entry. 
 Minimum time needed for the various processing. 
 Greater efficiency. 
 Better service. 
 User friendliness and interactive. 
 Minimum time required. 
 
 
 
 
Project Description

SOFTWARE DESCRIPTION 
Front end: 
Angular 
Introduction To Angular: 
 Angular is a platform and framework for building single-page client applications 
using HTML and TypeScript. Angular is written in TypeScript. It implements core 
and optional functionality as a set of TypeScript libraries that you import into your 
apps. 
 The architecture of an Angular application relies on certain fundamental concepts. 
The basic building blocks of the Angular framework are Angular components that are 
organized into NgModules. NgModules collect related code into functional sets; an 
Angular app is defined by a set of NgModules. An app always has at least a root 
module that enables bootstrapping, and typically has many more feature modules. 
 Components define views, which are sets of screen elements that Angular can choose 
among and modify according to your program logic and data. 
 Components use services, which provide specific functionality not directly related to 
views. Service providers can be injected into components as dependencies, making 
your code modular, reusable, and efficient. 
 Modules, components and services are classes that use decorators. These decorators 
mark their type and provide metadata that tells Angular how to use them. 
 The metadata for a component class associates it with a template that defines a view. 
A template combines ordinary HTML with Angular directives and binding markup 
that allow Angular to modify the HTML before rendering it for display. 
 The metadata for a service class provides the information Angular needs to make it 
available to components through dependency injection (DI). 
 An app's components typically define many views, arranged hierarchically. Angular 
provides the Router service to help you define navigation paths among views. The 
router provides sophisticated in-browser navigational capabilities. 
Modules: 
 Angular NgModules differ from and complement JavaScript (ES2015) modules. An 
NgModule declares a compilation context for a set of components that is dedicated to 
an application domain, a workflow, or a closely related set of capabilities. An 
NgModule can associate its components with related code, such as services, to form 
functional units. 
 Every Angular app has a root module, conventionally named AppModule, which 
provides the bootstrap mechanism that launches the application. An app typically 
contains many functional modules. 
 Like JavaScript modules, NgModules can import functionality from other 
NgModules, and allow their own functionality to be exported and used by other 
NgModules. For example, to use the router service in your app, you import the Router 
NgModule. 
 Organizing your code into distinct functional modules helps in managing 
development of complex applications, and in designing for reusability. In addition, 
this technique lets you take advantage of lazy-loading—that is, loading modules on 
demand—to minimize the amount of code that needs to be loaded at startup. 
Components: 
 Every Angular application has at least one component, the root component that 
connects a component hierarchy with the page document object model (DOM). Each 
component defines a class that contains application data and logic, and is associated 
with an HTML template that defines a view to be displayed in a target environment. 
 The @Component() decorator identifies the class immediately below it as a 
component, and provides the template and related component-specific metadata. 
 
Templates, directives, and data binding 
 A template combines HTML with Angular markup that can modify HTML elements 
before they are displayed. Template directives provide program logic, and binding 
markup connects your application data and the DOM. There are two types of data 
binding: 
 Event binding lets your app respond to user input in the target environment by 
updating your application data. 
 Property binding lets you interpolate values that are computed from your application 
data into the HTML. 
 Before a view is displayed, Angular evaluates the directives and resolves the binding 
syntax in the template to modify the HTML elements and the DOM, according to 
your program data and logic. Angular supports two-way data binding, meaning that 
changes in the DOM, such as user choices, are also reflected in your program data. 
 Your templates can use pipes to improve the user experience by transforming values 
for display. For example, use pipes to display dates and currency values that are 
appropriate for a user's locale. Angular provides predefined pipes for common 
transformations, and you can also define your own pipes. 
 
Service and Dependency Injection: 
 For data or logic that isn't associated with a specific view, and that you want to share 
across components, you create a service class. A service class definition is 
immediately preceded by the @Injectable() decorator. The decorator provides the 
metadata that allows other providers to be injected as dependencies into your class. 
 Dependency injection (DI) lets you keep your component classes lean and efficient. 
They don't fetch data from the server, validate user input, or log directly to the 
console; they delegate such tasks to services. 
Routing: 
 The router maps URL-like paths to views instead of pages. When a user performs an 
action, such as clicking a link, that would load a new page in the browser, the router 
intercepts the browser's behavior, and shows or hides view hierarchies. 
 If the router determines that the current application state requires particular 
functionality, and the module that defines it hasn't been loaded, the router can lazy
load the module on demand. 
 The router interprets a link URL according to your app's view navigation rules and 
data state. You can navigate to new views when the user clicks a button or selects 
from a drop box, or in response to some other stimulus from any source. The router 
logs activity in the browser's history, so the back and forward buttons work as well.

Back End: 
Java: 
 Java is an object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems, 
and it was released in 1995. 
 James Gosling initially developed Java in Sun Microsystems (which was later merged 
with Oracle Corporation). 
 Java is a set of features of C and C++. It has obtained its format from C, and OOP 
features from C++. 
 Java programs are platform independent which means they can be run on any 
operating system with any processor as long as the Java interpreter is available on that 
system. 
 Java code that runs on one platform does not need to be recompiled to run on another 
platform; it's called write once, run anywhere(WORA). 
 Java Virtual Machine (JVM) executes Java code, but it has been written in platform
specific languages such as C/C++/ASM, etc. JVM is not written in Java and hence 
cannot be platform independent, and Java interpreter is a part of JVM. 
Spring : 
 
 It was developed by Rod Johnson in 2003. Spring framework makes the easy 
development of JavaEE application. 
 Spring is a lightweight framework. It can be thought of as a framework of frameworks 
because it provides support to various frameworks such as Struts, Hibernate, Tapestry, 
EJB, JSF, etc. The framework, in broader sense, can be defined as a structure where 
we find solution of the various technical problems. 
 The Spring framework comprises several modules such as IOC, AOP, DAO, Context, 
ORM, WEB MVC etc. We will learn these modules in next page. Let's understand the 
IOC and Dependency Injection first. 
Spring Moules: 
 The Spring framework comprises of many modules such as core, beans, context, 
expression language, AOP, Aspects, Instrumentation, JDBC, ORM, OXM, JMS, 
Transaction, Web, Servlet, Struts etc. These modules are grouped into Test, Core 
Container, AOP, Aspects, Instrumentation, Data Access / Integration, Web (MVC / 
Remoting) as displayed in the following diagram. 
 
 
 
Spring Boot: 
     Spring Boot provides a good platform for Java developers to develop a stand-alone and 
production-grade spring application that you can just run. You can get started with minimum 
configurations without the need for an entire Spring configuration setup. 
 It provides a flexible way to configure Java Beans, XML configurations, and 
Database Transactions. 
 It provides a powerful batch processing and manages REST endpoints. 
 In Spring Boot, everything is auto configured; no manual configurations are needed. 
 It offers annotation-based spring application 
 Eases dependency management 
 It includes Embedded Servlet Container

DATABASE DESIGN 
 
 Database Design: 
 Database with Normalization: 
Database Normalization is a technique of organizing the data in the database. 
Normalization is a systematic approach of decomposing tables to eliminate data redundancy 
and undesirable characteristics like Insertion, Update and Deletion Anomalies. It is a multi
step process that puts data into tabular form by removing duplicated data from the relation 
tables. 
 Normalization: 
“Normalization is the process of converting complex data structures into simple and 
stable data structures.” 
Normalization is used for mainly two purpose, 
 Eliminating redundant (useless) data. 
 Ensuring data dependencies make sense i.e. data is logically stored. 
Normalization Steps:  
First Normal form (1NF). Any repeating groups have been removed so there is a single 
value at the intersection of each row and column of the table. 
First normal form (1NF) 
As per the rule of first normal form, an attribute (column) of a table cannot hold multiple 
values. It should hold only atomic values. 
 No non-prime attribute is dependent on the proper subset of any candidate key of 
table. 
An attribute that is not part of any candidate key is known as non-prime attribute. 
 
Table type: 
1. One to one 
2. One to many 
3. Many to one

Implementation 
Implementation  
This project “Freelance Management System” web application developed using 
Angular  Framework, Typescript as front-end and java, spring boot,  mysql as backend.  
The existing system caused long time transmission process but the system developed now has 
a very good user-friendly tool, which has a menu-based interface. 
All the server process are done through tomcat server. 
 
Testing & Maintenance 
 
The development process involves various types of testing. Each test type 
addresses a specific testing requirement. The most common types of testing involved in 
the development process are:  
 Unit Test 
 System Test 
 Integration Test 
 Functional Test 
 Performance Test 
 Beta Test 
 Acceptance Test 
 Validation Test 
 
Unit Testing 
The first test in the development process is the unit test. The source code is 
normally divided into modules, which in turn are divided into smaller units called units. 
These units have specific behavior. The test done on these units of code is called unit 
test. Unit test depends upon the language on which the project is developed. Unit tests 
ensure that each unique path of the project performs accurately to the documented 
specifications and contains clearly defined inputs and expected results. 
System Testing 
Several modules constitute a project. If the project is long-term project, several 
developers write the modules. Once all the modules are integrated, several errors may 
arise. The testing done at this stage is called system test.  System testing ensures that 
the entire integrated software system meets requirements. It tests a configuration to 
ensure known and predictable results. System testing is based on process descriptions 
and flows, emphasizing pre-driven process links and integration points.  
Testing a specific hardware/software installation. This is typically performed on 
a COTS (commercial off the shelf) system or any other system comprised of disparate 
parts where custom configurations and/or unique installations are the norm. 
Functional Testing 
Functional test can be defined as testing two or more modules together with the 
intent of finding defects, demonstrating that defects are not present, verifying that the 
module performs its intended functions as stated in the specification and establishing 
confidence that a program does what it is supposed to do. 
Integration Testing 
 
Testing in which modules are combined and tested as a group. Modules are 
typically code modules, individual applications, source and destination applications on 
a network, etc. Integration Testing follows unit testing and precedes system 
testing.Testing after the product is code complete. Betas are often widely distributed or 
even distributed to the public at large in hopes that they will buy the final product when 
it is released. 
 
White Box Testing 
Testing based on an analysis of internal workings and structure of a piece of 
software. This testing can be done sing the percentage value of load and energy. The 
tester should know what exactly is done in the internal program. Includes techniques 
such as Branch Testing and Path Testing. Also known as Structural Testing and Glass 
Box Testing. 
 
Black Box Testing 
Testing without knowledge of the internal workings of the item being tested. 
Tests are usually functional. This testing can be done by the user who has no 
knowledge of how the shortest path is found. 
 
 
Validation Testing 
 The process of evaluating software during the development process or at the 
end of the development process to determine whether it satisfies specified business 
requirements. Validation Testing ensures that the product actually meets the client's 
needs. Enter the ten digits mobile number for the test and if the number is correct, 
accept and proceed to the next page. Otherwise it will display an error message. 
 Maintenance: 
       Software maintenance is the modification of a software product after delivery to 
correct faults, to improve performance or other attributes. Software maintenance is a very 
broad activity that includes error corrections, enhancements of capabilities, deletion of 
absolute capabilities and optimization. Because change is inevitable, mechanism must be 
developed for evaluation, controlling and making modifications. So any work done to change 
the software after it is in operation is considered to be maintenance work. 
 
Maintenance Types: 
Preventive Maintenance: 
 Preventive maintenance is maintenance performed in an attempt to avoid failures, 
unnecessary production loss and safety violations. 
Corrective Maintenance: 
       This maintenance is often most expensive because worn equipment can damage 
other parts and cause multiple damage. Corrective maintenance is probably the most 
commonly used approach, but it is easy to see its limitations, if the equipment needs to be 
replaced, the cost of replacing it alone can be substantial. 
Adaptive Maintenance: 
 The adaptive maintenance modifiers software to properly interface with a 
changing environment. 
This project was the corrective maintenance because if the equipment needs to be replaced. 
The cost of replacing it alone can be substantial 
  
Conclusion

ABSTRACT 
A website succeeds when it meets the needs of the people who use it, when it performs flawlessly over a 
long period of time, when it is easy to modify and even easier to use, it can and does change things for the 
better. But when software fails when its users are dissatisfied, when it is error prone, when it is difficult to 
change and even harder to use-bad things can and do happen. We all want to create websites that makes 
things better, avoiding the bad things that lurk in the shadow of failed efforts. To succeed we need discipline 
when software is designed and built. Many individuals and companies still develop software haphazardly, 
even as they build systems to service the most advanced technologies of the day. As a result, the quality of 
the software that we produce suffers and bad things happen. This project report is intended to follow the 
guidelines for the website developed on E-Freelancing System. We have tried to follow the principles and 
rules as suggested by the software engineers as far as possible, in order to make this website a successful 
one.  
The report starts with a comprehensive introduction to the project which includes the objective and overview 
of the project followed by the hardware and software specifications. Literature survey is discussed thereafter 
followed by the system analysis and design that contains the flowcharts, diagrams, algorithms, code structure 
explaining the work and functions of the project.  
Finally, the results obtained are discussed in the report along with the references and appendices. The 
emphasis in this report is to document the important concepts and techniques used for the successful 
development of this project.  
We do hope fervently that, through this report, the readers will get a real picture of what the project is all 
about. I also wish that may this website satisfies all the needs and requirements of the user, for which it is 
meant.

CHAPTER 1 
INTRODUCTION 
1.1 
Problem Definition 
The system being proposed by the developer is a website which represents a freelance market place where 
clients can post projects and freelancers can bid for the projects. It is system where both the freelancers and 
the clients will be brought under the same roof. This is an era where most of the people prefer to work as a 
free man and not under the name of any organization. Online freelance market place is such a platform to 
such freelancers where they get paid for their work and at times, this makes work more in a fun game. 
Similarly, clients, which can be any organization, any group or any individual. willing to offer their projects 
to be outsourced and developed by other people and that too within a fixed budget range acceptable to both 
the parties. For both the above two kinds of people, the proposed system is a proper solution-"An online 
freelance market place" 
1.2 
Project Overview 
E-Freelancing system is an application of project management to the creation and development of large scale 
projects. The process of planning and coordinating all the projects is usually referred to as employee 
planning and which can include budgeting, scheduling, site selection, acquiring necessary permits. This web 
system helps employees and employers to get the required working platform for the freelancers and hard 
working freelancer for the organization. This website is very useful for the skilled professionals who wants 
to do work from home job with a great monthly income. There are many types of freelancers required for the 
organization according to the requirement of their projects: 
 Web Developer 
 Graphic Designer 
 Project Manager 
 Android Developer 
Web Developer 
Web developers create and maintain websites. They are also responsible for the site's technical aspects, such 
as its performance and capacity, which are measures of a website's speed and how much traffic the site can 
handle. In addition, web developers may create content for the site.

Graphic Designer 
lOMoARcPSD|47199858
Graphic designers create visual concepts, using computer software or by hand, to communicate ideas that 
inspire, inform, and captivate consumers. They develop the overall layout and production design for 
applications such as advertisements, brochures, magazines, and reports. 
Project Manager 
A project manager is a professional who organizes, plans, and executes projects while working within 
restraints like budgets and schedules. Project managers are in charge of leading teams, defining goals, 
communicating with stakeholders, and seeing a project through to its closure. 
Android Developer 
An Android Developer is a Software Developer who specializes in designing applications for the Android 
marketplace. The Android marketplace is the direct competitor to Apple's app store. This means most of an 
Android Developer's job revolves around creating the apps we use on our smartphones and tablets.

CHAPTER 2 
LITERATURE SURVEY 
2.1 Existing System 
This existing system is not providing secure registration and profile management of all the users properly.  
This system is not providing online help. This system doesn’t provide tracking of user activities and their 
progress. This manual system gives us very less security for saving data and some data may be lost due to 
mismanagement.  This system is not providing project management through internet. This system is not 
providing proper employees and employers information. The system is giving manual information through 
the admin of the web system. 
2.2 Proposed System 
E-Freelancing System is an Online freelancing software project that serves the functionality of a freelancer 
looking for the projects. The system allows only registered users to login and new users are allowed to 
register on the application. This is a web application but desktop application of the same application is also 
available. The project provides most of the basic functionality required for a freelancer and an organization. 
It allows the user to select the project of his domain and bid on a project posted by an employer. Once the 
user selects the project in which he wants to work, the system then allows the freelancer to send the message 
to the organization or employer and cost for the project, the freelancer will work. After getting the message 
for employee, the employer will review the profile of the employee and will check it out his desired cost for 
the project. 
2.3 Feasibility Study 
A feasibility study is a high-level capsule version of the entire System analysis and Design Process. The 
study begins by classifying the problem definition. Feasibility is to determine if it’s worth doing. Once an 
acceptance problem definition has been generated, the analyst develops a logical model of the system. A 
search for alternatives is analysed carefully. There are 3 parts in feasibility study. 
2.3.1 Operational Feasibility 
Page 11 of 26 
Downloaded by Suleiman Abdulkadir (sulea841@gmail.com)
lOMoARcPSD|47199858
Operational feasibility is the measure of how well a proposed system solves the problems, and takes 
advantage of the opportunities identified during scope definition and how it satisfies the requirements 
identified in the requirements analysis phase of system development .The operational feasibility assessment 
focuses on the degree to which the proposed development projects fits in with the existing business 
environment and objectives with regard to development schedule, delivery date, corporate culture and 
existing business processes .To ensure success, desired operational outcomes must be imparted during 
design and development. These include such design-dependent parameters as reliability, maintainability, 
supportability, usability, producibility, disposability, sustainability, affordability and others. These 
parameters are required to be considered at the early stages of design if desired operational behaviours are to 
be realised. A system design and development require appropriate and timely application of engineering and 
management efforts to meet the previously mentioned parameters. A system may serve its intended purpose 
most effectively when its technical and operating characteristics are engineered into the design. Therefore, 
operational feasibility is a critical aspect of systems engineering that needs to be an integral part of the early 
design phases. 
2.3.2 Technical Feasibility 
This involves questions such as whether the technology needed for the system exists, how difficult it will be 
to build, and whether the firm has enough experience using that technology. The assessment is based on 
outline design of system requirements in terms of input, processes, output, fields, programs and procedures. 
This can be qualified in terms of volume of data, trends, frequency of updating in order to give an 
introduction to the technical system. The application is the fact that it has been developed on windows XP 
platform and a high configuration of 1GB RAM on Intel Pentium Dual core processor. This is technically 
feasible. The technical feasibility assessment is focused on gaining an understanding of the present technical 
resources of the organization and their applicability to the expected needs of the proposed system. It is an 
evaluation of the hardware and software and how it meets the need of the proposed system. 
2.3.3 Economical Feasibility 
Establishing the cost-effectiveness of the proposed system i.e. if the benefits do not outweigh the costs then 
it is not worth going ahead. In the fast paced world there is a great need of online social networking 
facilities. Thus, the benefits of this project in the current scenario make it economically feasible. The 
purpose of the economic feasibility assessment is to determine the positive economic benefits to the 
organization that the proposed system will provide. It includes quantification and identification of all the 
benefits expected. This assessment typically involves a cost/benefits analysis.

CHAPTER 3 
SYSTEM ANALYSIS AND DESIGN 
3.1 Requirement Specification 
In the SRS (Software Requirement Specification), three parties are involved-the client, end users and 
software developer. The requirements document has to be such that the client and user can understand it 
easily and the developer can use it as a basis for software development. The SRS is a document that 
completely describes what the proposed system should do without describing how the software will do. The 
basic goal of the requirements face is to produce the SRS, which describe the complete external behaviour of 
the proposed software. The scope of SRS document is valid until the end of the project. Because, it is the 
basic for all the phases. Only on the basis of SRS, whole project is developed. This is the only document that 
describes the requirement of the system. It is meant for used by the developer and will be the basic for 
validating the final delivered system. Any change made to the requirement in the future will have to go 
through a formal change process. 
The Requirement Specification for this project is as follows: 
i. 
ii. 
iii. 
iv. 
v. 
User Friendly: Developed System is user-friendly and easy to use so that native user can easily 
learn to use the system 
Responsive and Light Design: Website adjusts very well on multiple devices and being it a 
Progressive Web App, it performs just as an native application on mobile devices. 
Flexible: System developed is flexible and can adjust with any changes or alterations done in no 
time they can be deployed live. 
Cost Element: Memory consumption is close to none as the data is stored on cloud storage and 
not on local disks. 
Information Security: Records of the user data and other sensitive information is handled 
securely and efficiently. 
3.2 Diagrams (DFDs / ERD / Use Case) 
Use Case Diagram: 
A use case diagram is a graphic depiction of the interactions among the elements of a system. A use case is a 
methodology used in system analysis to identify, clarify, and organize system requirements.

lOMoARcPSD|47199858
In this context, the term "system" refers to something being developed or operated. Use case diagrams are 
employed in UML (Unified Modelling Language), a standard notation for the modelling of real-world 
objects and systems. It includes contents which defines –  
• Users – who actually will use the system.  
• Use Cases and, 
• The relationships between the Users and Use Cases. 
The use case diagram of our project is here:

Entity-Relationship Diagram: 
ER Diagram displays the relationship of entity sets stored in a database. In other words, ER diagrams help to 
explain the logical structure of databases.  
ER diagrams are created based on three basic concepts: 
 Entities 
 Attributes and 
 Relationships.

3.3 Design and Test Steps 
lOMoARcPSD|47199858
3.3.1 Design: 
Design is the first step in development phase for any techniques and principles for the purpose of 
defining a device, a process or system in sufficient detail to permit its physical realization. Once the 
software requirement has been analysed and specified the software design involves three technical 
activities-Design, Coding, Implementation, Testing that are required to build and verify the software. 
The design activities are of main importance in this phase, because in this activity decisions 
ultimately affecting the success of the software implementation and its ease of maintenance are 
made. This decision has the final bearing upon reliability and maintainability of a system. Design is 
only way to accurately transfer the customer’s requirements into finished software or system. Design 
is the place where quality is fostered in development. Software design is the process through which 
requirements are translated into a representation of software. Software requirement is conducted in 
two steps. Preliminary design is concerned with the transformation of requirements into data. 
3.3.2 Test Steps: 
System Testing: System testing is the process of checking whether the developed system is working 
according to the objective and requirement.  
Some testing criteria which have been fulfilled are as follows: 
(Procedure discussed in section 3.5)  
Black Box Testing: Alluding the tests that are conducted at the software interface in order to 
examine the fundamental aspects of the system with a little regard to the logical structure.  
White Box Testing: It tends to help in testing all the independent paths within a module which 
includes all the logical decisions, loops and scopes, referencing variables and memory usage.  
Unit Testing: It is performed to test the validity of individual units with interactive testing.

CONCLUSION 
While developing the project a conscious effort has been made to create and develop a software 
package, making use of available tools, techniques and resources. During development, an eye has 
been kept on making it as user friendly. As such one may hope that the system will be acceptable to 
any user and will adequately meet his/her needs. 
As in case of any system development process where there are a number of short comings, there have 
been some shortcomings in the development of this system also. 
There are some of the areas of improvement which couldn't be implemented due to time constraints.

Abstract: [Context] Freelancers could catalyze the software development process by providing their
niche skills to generate high quality outputs. They could help companies (including startups) to
foster innovations by suggesting creative ideas and providing their expertise in implementing them
(for instance, designing solutions, coding solutions etc.). Freelancers could effectively and efficiently
work as a virtual member of the software development team. The company must make informed
decisions about which task to allot to the freelancer, which freelancer to select, pricing the task,
and evaluating the submitted work. On the other hand, the freelancer should make an informed
decisionaboutevaluatingthemonetaryvalueofthetasktobecharged,trustingtherequester,analyzing
the skills requirement of the task (finding matches between skill requirement and skills processed),
selecting the best task, and maintaining the highest level of reputation. However, the literature does
notprovidefreelancersandthecompaniestheguidelinesthatsupporttheirdecisionmaking. However,
if freelancers are selected carefully for the most suitable task, the companies will benefit a lot in terms
of improved software development metrics. [Objectives] The objective of this paper is to provide the
research community the research trends in freelancer-supported software development. This helps to
understand that which software development areas have higher concentrations of research efforts,
whichareahasthesupportofempiricalevidencetosupportmanagementdecisionmakings,andwhich
area requires the research attention. [Method] The systematic study is conducted by planning the
mapping protocol, executing the protocol, and reporting the findings using various visualization
tools like bar charts and pie charts. The search process was planned to be executed using set
of inclusion and exclusion conditions on four bibliographic databases (IEEExplore, Springerlink,
Sciencedirect, and ACM digital library). The relevant papers are selected by applying inclusion and
exclusion conditions. The google citations of the relevant papers are subject to the inclusion and
exclusion conditions again to include the more relevant papers. Finally, the systematic schema was

focus of the researchers (total 7 studies in 2019) is on generic software development handling
the collaboration and coordination (3 studies out of 7), Developer recommendation (2 studies out
of 7), and task recommendation (2 studies out of 7). [Conclusion] The freelancer-driven software
engineering research area has got the attraction of the researchers, but it will take a long time to
gain maturity. This puts an urgent call for more empirical studies and evaluation-based solution
research that could help companies (including startups) to foster innovations. Further, the research
focus should be well distributed among the various development phases to address the unique
challenges associated with individual activities. The accurate management of the freelancer in
the software development could help companies and startups to foster innovations and remain
competitive in the marketplace.

1. Introduction
Freelancers the self-employed people who have a short term, task-based association with the
employer and thus they are not a part of the company workforce (i.e., they are not the employees).
Their association with the company is only until the allocated task is successfully completed and thus
they do not have long term commitments (or working associations) with the company as expected
from the full time employees. They have an obligation to complete the task with high quality
standards within the agreed deadline, in exchange for the money (agreed price of the outsourced tasks).
During the time the freelancer has been executing the outsourced task, they are free to undertake more
freelancing tasks with different requesters (different companies), with different contractual conditions.
In other words, the freelancers undertake multiple projects in parallel. Freelancers do not have strict
and lengthy written employment contracts as exist in full time employment. The outsourcing of the
tasks (also termed as projects) in the freelancing world (gig economy) works as follows:
(a)
The company requests for the services of the freelancers. This could be accomplished in either of
the following ways:
• Publishingtaskdescription,deadline,price,andotherconditionsonthefreelancingplatforms
or on the company website or on social media or on the platforms managed by the
company itself. This approach requires open call for freelancer participation and is thus
crowdsourcing-based freelancing.
• Thefreelancersintheprofessionalnetworksofthesoftwarecompany(orstartups)aredirectly
approachedwiththeoutsourcingrequest. Thisapproachisusuallyundertakenifthedeadline
for execution of the project is too strict that prohibits the idea of outsourcing to the crowd.
This approach does not require open call for participation of freelancers in undertaking
outsourcing tasks andis thusnon-crowdsourcing-basedfreelancing. Thecompanycouldalso
maintain their own panel of expert freelancers which could be approached in crowdsourcing
or non-crowdsourced manner, which is termed as panel-based freelancing model in [1].
Authors in [1] have classification the freelancing association models into task-based,
panel-based, or hybrid. Either of the models could be executed in crowdsourced or
non-crowdsourced manner.
(b) Freelancers registers their expression of interest in undertaking the outsourced tasks.
(c)
The company performs the selection of the freelancers for assigning the task for execution.
Theselectionisquitesimpleinnon-crowdsourcing-basedmodels. Insuchamodel,theapproached
freelancer (which is capable as per company previous working relations) and the requesting
company undergo negotiations. If such negotiations are successful, the task is assigned to
Processes 2020, 8, 1215
3 of 25
the freelancer. In Crowdsourced models, the freelancer selection for the pool of interested
freelancer list could be accomplished in a variety of the ways as mentioned below:
• Screen the profiles of the interested freelancers by analyzing their reputation and their
capability to produce high quality work. The ratings, previous reviews, sample of previously
executed tasks etc. could be helpful. The freelancers could also be interviewed to make
f
inal decisions.
• Evaluatefreelancers based on the brief abstract solution provided by them, finally leading to
their selection. The abstract solution is the partial solution about the task to be outsourced.
To accomplish this, the company must request for abstract solutions at the time the request
for the participation was registered on the platform.
• Evaluatethesolutionsgivenbyfreelancersandselectthebestoneforthereward. Thisrequires
the company to request for the complete solutions of the task at the time the request
for the participation was registered on the platform. The best solutions are rewarded.
This crowdsourcing takes the form of the competition, but it is usually undertaken for the
tasks that are not computationally hard and effortful (for instance, logo designing). As the
software engineering tasks are effortful, computational hard problems to solve and complex,
a competition-based approach is likely to be less feasible here.
(d) Thefreelancer submits the work, which is evaluated by the company. After the positive outcome
of the evaluation, the freelancer is rewarded with the money (outsourcing task price).
Thus, there are different ways of inviting interest, screening applicants, selecting and evaluating
thework. However,theresearcherscategorizefreelancingaseithercrowdsourcedornon-crowdsourced.
In thecrowdsourcedmodel,thecompanysendsanopencalltoacrowdoffreelancers. Freelancerscould
collaborate (usually never happens), take part in a competition, or undertake microtask independently.
In the non-crowdsourced model, the company selects one freelancer to independently work on the
problem (task) to generate a solution. Freelancing activity in software engineering is challenging,
as the freelancer should have perfect skills and competencies to handle the technical task (skill match).
It is very effortful to invite the interest of a freelancer, select a freelancer from the big pool (or select
tasks from the big pool), negotiate the terms and conditions, communicate during the task execution,
evaluate submitted work, and trust that payment will be made. The entire process is highly uncertain
and risky. This is because the submission of the work and its quality is probabilistic.
Software companies need to continuously innovate their products (or services) to maintain
competitive advantage in highly volatile markets i.e., by continuously providing more and more
benefits to thesoftware users. Thecompaniesalsocontinuouslytrytodoprocessinnovationtoimprove
the software development processes that lead to the benefits to the firms which could be passed on
to the users. Thus, the process innovation could also help the company to improve their products
and increase the value they provide to its markets. The growth of the companies in the markets
helps them to enhance their resources but their organizational processes become more and structured.
For instance, the big software company will have a very organized organizational structure with
well-defined processes for everything. This limits the ability of the companies to innovate as the rigid
structures will resist the changes required to innovate. Further, technologies and customer needs
are changing so fast that the big companies may find it very costly (or even harder) to employ the
software engineer with niche skills for undertaking the task in hand. These companies may also
wish to employ the specialist for short term basis if the requirement for the specialization is for short
term only. The startup phase of the companies is more challenging because of the need to continuously
innovate because of resource limitations and an ever-changing environment [2]. However, this phase
has very flexible organizational structure and processes which are most favorable for supporting
the innovation activities. The outcome of the discussion is that the companies (starting from their
startup phase) must continuously innovate by overcoming the restrictions imposed by resources and
agility of the organizational processes and structures. Innovation not only require the gathering
Processes 2020, 8, 1215

of the creative ideas but also their implementation and release in the markets to generate value to
the customers. For instance, the company may have a brilliant idea about a new product feature,
but they need to implement it by executing software engineering process which include generic
activities like designing, coding, testing, and release. The resource limitations and flexibility issues
with the organizational processes and structures will be effectively managed by outsourcing the
innovative idea implementation tasks to the freelancers. Freelancers could also be meaningful sources
for suggesting innovative ideas to the companies that could be implemented inhouse or outsourced to
the freelancers [3].
Software development involves many effortful, complex, and hard activities like
requirement engineering, designing solutions, coding solutions, testing solutions and release,
which must be executed continuously (evolutionary software engineering). Each activity
imposes different constraints like skills requirement, environment challenges, coordination issues,
collaboration issues, need for documentation, etc. The software engineering task to be outsourced
should be assigned to the freelancers with the necessary competencies required for the task to be
successfully executed. The employing of freelancers is a good solution provided that the effort of
managing freelancing is exceeded by the cost and time reductions it brings to the development.
The software companies expect from the research community the effective solutions that could
help them to involve freelancers in suitable software development activity and empirical guidelines
that could help them to take decisions in the directions. The support of empirical evidences will foster
the decision making process of the company management about different aspects including (a) hiring
the freelancer vs. undertaking the task in house; (b) identification of the software engineering activity
that should be outsourced to freelancers; (c) establishing price estimated; (d) deciding the model for
freelancer associations; (e) decision about the crowdsourcing platforms etc. The overall objective is
to include freelancers in the software engineering activities to foster innovations in the company to
remain competitive in the marketplace.
This paper aims to undertake a systematic mapping study (Section 2) to understand the trends in
freelancer-supported software development by structuring this area around software development
activity focused, challenges and issues reported, type of research undertaken by the researchers and
the temporal trends (publication trends). The objective is to explore this area to maximum breadth,
using an efficient mapping protocol to identify the research gaps or the areas that require urgent
research focus. This needs the research to bifurcate the complex domain of freelancer supported
software engineering into meaningful information to identify the state of art. This state of art will help
to identify the research gaps that could motivate the researchers to bridge those gaps by providing
empirical guidelines, tools, and techniques for fostering freelancer involvement in various software
engineering activities. This will help the software companies (including the startups) to adopt the
research solutions provided by the researchers as per the working context unique to their companies to
improve software success rates and overcoming resource limitations.
Providing a holistic view of the research area justifies the execution of the research study as a
systematic mapping study over a systematic literature review. This is because systematic mapping
studies are well suited to provide classification and counting of the broad research areas rather
providing empirical evidence-based on the synthesis of the literature [4]. The systematic mapping
study conducted in this paper is based on the guidelines disseminated in [5].
This paper is structured as follows; the background related to systematic mapping is given in
Section 2. TheplanningofthemappingprotocolisgiveninSection3byhighlightingresearchquestions,
search string, bibliographic databases, inclusion and exclusion conditions and data aggregation
and synthesis. Section 3 executes the mapping protocol and highlights the search results. The data
contained in search results are extracted to answer research questions in the same section. This leads
to discussions in Section 4, with threats to validity in Section 5. Finally, the paper is concluded and
directions for future work are mentioned in Section 6.

2. Background
The systematic mapping studies are undertaken to structure the research area into categories
(classification schema), that represents the research trends/focus in the area. Such studies are
conducted to get a broad overview of the research available in the research area by undertaking the
classification (identifying categories and relationships) and counting (number of publications within
classification scheme). This helps the researchers to have a holistic view of the research efforts made by
other researchers in the area and identify the research gaps. As this study involves a broad view of
the research area, the research questions are formulated broadly (mappings are broad studies rather
deeply conducted). The much focus of these studies is to not provide empirical evidence by deeply
analyzing the research studies, but rather to highlight the research trends. Thus, the number of studies
that forms the basis of systematic study are usually very large and are synthesized by analyzing their
abstracts (and conclusion if abstracts are ambiguous). The reliability of such studies is a big issue due
to bias involved [6]. The guidelines to conduct the mapping studies are disseminated in [4,5].
Authors in [4] suggested that the mapping studies should involve the following steps:
• DefinitionofResearch Questions (Defining research scope).
• Conductsearch.
• Screeningofthe papers.
• Keywordsusingabstracts.
• Dataextraction and Mapping process.
Research questions are broadly formulated, and bibliographic databases are searched (conducting
a search), resulting in a large number of papers. These papers are screened according to the conditions
laid down in mapping protocol (inclusion and exclusion criteria) to filter out the non-relevant ones.
The relevant ones are subjected for further analysis to create the classification schema. The information
extracted by abstracts (and conclusion) is used to populate the classification schema. The mapping
process thus consists of three stages i.e., Planning the mapping protocol, executing the protocol,
and reporting the findings.
To the best of the researcher’s knowledge, the literature lacks the mapping studies that investigate
the trends in employing freelancers for the software development. The software development
involves a large number of complex activities with high uncertainties, high costs, and time delays.
Freelancers could be useful to undertake such challenging tasks, which provides companies the
opportunity to take advantage of the freelancer’s niche skills, minimization of cost and time,
and increased quality. However, these benefits are incurred only if the freelancers are carefully
selected to undertake the tasks for which they have the best match to the skills required by the task to
be executed.
3. Research Method
3.1. Research Questions
The systematic mapping study protocol tries to find answers to the research questions with
the objective of analyzing the research trends of employing the freelancers for the software
development tasks. The research questions are framed broadly to meet the objective of capturing
the research patterns over the years, focusing on researchers focus, patterns of reported issues,
and challenges. The Population and Interventions of the PICO framework are only used to frame
research questions, to be less restrictive in conducting the search process.
Research Questions
RQ1.Which software development process activities have involved the freelancers?
RQ2.Which Issues and challenges are associated with the freelancer involvement in the software
development process?
Processes 2020, 8, 1215
6 of 25
RQ3.How does freelancer supported software development research can be classified in terms of
research type?
RQ4.Howdoes the freelancer supported software development research evolved over the time?
3.2. Search String and Bibliographic Databases
The systematic mapping protocol triggers four bibliographic databases against the search string
formulatedas(Freelancer*)AND(“SoftwareEngineering”OR“SoftwareDevelopment”). Thedatabases
were triggered for the publications published from 2015 to 2020 to yield an initial list of publications
on 17th March 2020.
The use of the three keywords i.e., freelancer*, software engineering, and software development,
extracts those papers that specially mention freelancer (or freelancers) in the context of software
development and/or software engineering. This excludes the studies focused on crowdsourcing
in general without focusing on freelancers in particular. The objective of this paper is to analyze
the studies, especially based on freelancers and not on generic crowdsourcing.
The initial list is subjected to the selection process in accordance with the Inclusion and exclusion
criteria to get a final list of studies to answer research questions. Following that, four Bibliographic
databases were searched for studies to meet the objectives of this research paper.
• IEEExplore.
• ACMDigitalLibrary.
• Springerlink.
• Sciencedirect.
The google scholar citations of the final papers were subjected to inclusion and exclusion criteria.
Those satisfying the conditions are added to the list of selected studies that are considered in this paper.
3.3. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
Execution of the systematic mapping protocol search string yields a large number of papers.
All these papers do not have the ability to answer the research questions that are of prime interest for
the researchers i.e., does not answer within the research scope. The extracted papers are subjected to
the selection process by executing the conditions in inclusion and exclusion criteria. Further, the google
citations of the final papers were subjected to filtering on the basis of the inclusion and exclusion criteria.
The final papers are analyzed to answer the framed research questions. The systematic mapping
protocol for this paper specified the following conditions for the inclusion and exclusion of research
studies for further analysis.
The objectivity of the inclusion and exclusion criteria is ensured by testing it over the same
bibliographic databases, using the same search string but only for the year 2020. The resulting papers
selected by each researcher are compared with each other to match the level of agreements between
researcher’s selection decisions. Although there was high agreement, minor changes were made in
some inclusion and exclusion criteria to enhance its objectivity.
Inclusion Criteria
• Papers must be related to software engineering and freelancers (both crowdsourcing and
non-crowdsourcing-based freelancers)
• Papersmustbeabletoanswer either of research questions.
• Papers with clear and understandable abstract, making researchers able to answer either
research question.
• Papermustbewrittenin English.
Exclusion Criteria
• Paperswritten in any other language except English,
Processes 2020, 8, 1215
7 of 25
• Papersnotableto answer either research question.
• Papers not based on Software Engineering and freelancers (i.e., filtering out generic
crowdsourcing papers)
• Papersmentioning the freelancers in software engineering only at abstract levels.
• Allexcept the one occurrence of the Papers appearing multiple times in various bibliographic
databases are excluded.
• Papers with minimal details about the findings about freelancers in software development,
requiring researchers read the entire paper. For example, consider the paper with an abstract,
mentioning the following: researchers report various challenges in employing freelancers for
small projects in the paper. Such papers are filtered out as they require researchers to read the
entire paper to gather reported challenges.
3.4. Data Aggregation and Synthesis
The abstracts of the final papers will be subjected to analysis. The analysis will result in the
identification of related categories that answers the framed research questions. This is termed as
structured schema. During the process of reading abstracts, for each research question, the related
keywords are identified and merged to create this schema. To ensure validity of the results, the data
extracted from the studies were first added to the data extraction form and then mapped to the
conceptual schemas. The structure of data extraction form is given in Annex-I by all the researchers.
Anydisagreements were resolved in the consensus meetings.
Thedataextractedafterabstract analysis is used topopulatetheindividualschema, whichanswers
the individual formulated research questions under investigation. The extracted data for the categories
of schema are maintained in google excel sheet to classify and count the research types associated
with them (research questions 3 and 4). This excel sheet helps to count the artefacts of interest to the
researchers to answer research questions 3 and 4, which involve further categorization and counting.
4. Results
4.1. Search Results
The execution of the systematic mapping protocol resulted in 17 studies being selected from four
bibliographic databases. The google citations of 17 papers were analyzed and 19 of these citations
were found to satisfy the inclusion conditions as laid down in mapping protocol. A total of 36 papers
were considered for analysis for meeting the objective of this research. The result of execution of the
search process, first over individual databases and then over citations as per the protocol, are given in

RQ1.Which software development process activities have involved the freelancers?
The different software development areas where the freelancers are employed are given in
Table 5. The categories of development areas are identified through the analysis of abstracts. However,
many papers did not mention the development area. Such studies are categorized in the “Generic
Development” (meaning software development process as a whole) category in this paper.

The activities mentioned in Table 5 are the only software engineering activities where freelancers
were involved as reported by the literature studies. The formulation of the category labels and
classification of the studies in these categories were made on the basis of the software engineering
activity that the literature studies have focused on.
For some studies, the identification of categories and their assignment to those categories was the
biggest challenge. To accomplish this, some assumptions were made in the categorization process.
For instance, the two labels, i.e., “software evolution” and “requirement management” as used
in this study, consider the categorization driven by the difference of the focus of the studies on
the software evolution. For instance, the study as given in [40] is categorized under the label
“software evolution” as it suggests the recommendation of the software features to be released in the
next version of the software system (focus on software evolution).
However, the studies focusing on requirement management without any focus on software
evolution (focusing on managing requirement for a particular version only rather than driving next
version development), are assigned to Requirement management category. The study as given in [27]
deals with resource management and is hence assigned to the Project Planning category.
Table 5 shows that the majority of the research studies disseminates the aspects related to
freelancing for the overall software development. These studies are not particularly based on specific
software development areas. Programming/Coding is the main focus of studies that are based

recommendation system will recommend suitable freelancers to the requesters after the task is
outsourced in the crowd of freelancers requesting for their participation. The recommendation
is made on the optimal combination of the values representing the freelancer’s ability to execute
the task. This may include their skills, previous ratings, recent feedback, average time to completion,
average charges charged, etc. The developer recommendation is a challenging activity because it is
hard to identify parameters for the recommendation, dynamically updating the parameter values,
matching task requirements with developer competencies, etc. Most of the studies either propose a
recommendation system or report the challenges with recommendations.
Team formulation is reported by 14% of the studied papers. The challenge associated with the
Teamformulationisthedifficultyexperiencedbysoftwarecompaniestoformtheteamoffreelancersfor
undertaking the crowdsourced tasks. This may be due to the coordination and communication issues,
which leads to trust issues. Further, freelancers work from their workplaces as per their own schedule,
so establishing the co-located team working is very difficult.
Trust issues (8%) emerge when requesters are not sure if the freelancers will be able to work
together and will submit the requested solutions. The trust issues emerge because both freelancers
and requestors do not know each other. The freelancers are not sure if requestors will pay them after
completion of the work. The requestors are not sure if the freelancers will submit the solutions at
all or if they do, then whether the submission will be of acceptance quality standards and within
the deadline. The freelancing platforms have maintained the work profile of both freelancers and
the requestors, to help each other to establish trust. Further, the requestors deposit the freelancer
payments with the platform, which is only released to freelancers after the requestors have positively
evaluated the quality standards of the deliverables delivered by the freelancers.
Ontheopposite side of developer recommendation, there is task recommendation (14%). Stated in
other words, this will recommend suitable tasks to the developer, which otherwise will be quite
effortful to search amongst the numeroustasks. Privacyandsecurity(11%)associatedwiththesoftware
artefacts are another observed challenge as reported in the studies. The objective is to maintain privacy
of the objects related to the project described in the outsourced task and securing the company or
project related information that could be meaningful to the competitors. This could be accomplished
in many freelancing platforms by signing non-disclosure agreements with the freelancers to avoid
sharing the project related information with third parties. Additionally, the tasks are designed in a
manner that gives minimal information about the project background. Confidentiality associated with
the task to be crowdsourced is reported in 11% of the studies.
Intellectual Property Issues had been reported by 6% of the studies. The objective here is to
establish the ownership of the solution submitted by the freelancers. The requestors should be the
owner of the solution, but this issue need to be resolved before outsourcing the task, i.e., whether the
intellectual property ownership will remain with the platform, freelancer, or with the requestor.
Market dynamics (6%), i.e., changes in the market, affects the activities related to the
outsourcing of the tasks. For instance, continuous changes in the market like supply of niche skills,
ongoing market rate, etc. affects the prices to be offered to freelancers. Participation of the crowd
workers, i.e., freelancers had been reported in 6% of the studies. The challenge is to ensure that
the freelancer participates in the freelancing activities continuously. The opportunities to learn,
gain money, social interaction, etc. should motivate them to continuously take part in the execution of
the outsourced tasks.
These challenges had a direct impact on each other. For example, communication helps to enhance
coordination and collaboration, which enhances trust. This impacts team formulation, which impacts
trust issues.

5. Discussion
The research studies had been focused on improving the generic software development activities
The research studies had been focused on improving the generic software development activities 
by employing freelancers rather employing them for different development activities (Figure 1). The 
software development activities require different technical skills and expertise. The software 
companies may not have immediate availability of the human resources with the niche skills to 
undertake the particular task. The small companies and the startups may have limited resources with 
multiple roles to perform. The limited resources limit the ability to implement innovative ideas. 
Freelancers seem to be a good option as they bridge the skill gaps and provide ability to these firms 
by employing freelancers rather employing them for different development activities (Figure 1).

Freelancers seem to be a good option as they bridge the skill gaps and provide ability to these firms
www.mdpi.com/journal/processes 
to implement innovations. The successful associations with the freelancers depend on the accurate
selection of the freelancer from the pool of interested freelancers. Individual software development
activities require different skills and processes different research challenges to address. The same
freelancer pool cannot serve the requirements of all development activities. The researchers’ focus
on adopting the freelancers involvement in all software engineering activities uniformly will help to
Processes 2020, 8, 1215
19 of 25
provide empirical evidences, tools, and techniques to the companies that will help them accurately
design tasks to be outsourced, accurately select freelancer, accurately establish working relations in
the distributed team, maintain ethical standards, and find value generating solutions to the problem.
The current state of art is that the freelancer’s involvement across different development activities is
non-uniform, with a major focus on generic software development (Figures 1 and 2).
For instance, the failure rates of the startups are due to requirement related issues [44–47] and the
product development issues [48]. The state of research in the domain of the requirement engineering
in the startup context is still in early stages. The literature has limited ability to support the startups in
the form of empirical evidence, evaluated solutions, etc. that could be adopted as per their working
context and finally implemented [2]. Big companies also do a lot of marketing research to identify the
innovative ideas for product innovation i.e., changing the product to enhance value to the customer.
The startups and big companies could involve the freelancers in requirement engineering activity
not only to generate new product ideas but also to create requirement models and mapping models
to the requirement specification documentation [3]. The freelancers could be of prime importance
in undertaking requirement management activity since they are globally distributed over the globe.
They could be used as the source of the requirements for future software versions and as a source of
effective feedback for supporting the software evolution [3].
However, employing freelancers for requirement management will require empirical studies to
investigate issues like trust, confidentiality, validation of freelancer feedback, value-based pricing,
motivations to support their active participation (especially for financially constrained startups), etc.
The solution strategies will be challenging to be evaluated in live settings as simulating the live
experience will be effortful and difficult.
Further, the number of empirical studies focusing on individual and overall software development
are very limited (Figures 1–3). This limits the empirical evidence that could attract researchers’ interest,
highlight unique challenges, and suggest research gaps. The lack of experience reports and
opinions (which are shared by other companies) in the literature limits the sharing of the knowledge
(lesson learned) that could bebeneficialtothecompaniesseekingadviceaboutfreelancer’sinvolvement.
The literature provides 72% validation studies (Figure 3), meaning that solutions are validated in
laboratory settings only. Their effectiveness is yet to be established in real settings. This implies that
the existing solutions must be checked for their feasibility to be used in industrial settings to gather
the real time metrics associated with their impact on the overall business. Limited studies signify
that the area has got the attraction of the researchers, but it will take a long time to gain maturity.
This puts urgent call for more empirical studies and evaluation-based solution research that could
help companies (including startups) to foster innovations. Further, the research focus should be well
distributed among the various development phases to address the unique challenges associated with
individual activities.
The studied research papers identified various challenges and issues that are incurred in
involving freelancers. The reported challenges are ranked in order of number of studies reporting them.
However, there exists a relation among the challenges and issues. For example, coordination and
collaboration affect team formulation, trust, quality of work, communication and so on. This implies
that ranked challenges could represent the prime parameters for targets of future research, yet the
researchers must consider their interrelationships.
The literature does not focus on different models of freelancer associations with the company as
identified in [1]. The crowdsourced freelancing is only focused while the non-crowdsourced-based
associations are not available in the literature. However, freelancing could be crowdsourced or
non-crowdsourced, meaning all crowdsourcing models are freelancing models but not vice versa.
The challenges associated with the different freelancing models are unique and thus put different
constraints on their execution for software development.
Processes 2020, 8, 1215

In particular, this mapping study highlights the need for more empirical research followed by a
solution-based research with strong applicability in the industrial settings. The research must focus,
in particular, on the individual development life cycle activities and in general the overall development.
6. Threat to Validity
The requirement for the consistent and complete reporting of validity threats in software
engineering research had been reported in [5,6]. However, this paper addresses the threats to
four types of validity as identified in [5]. This includes the descriptive validity, theoretical validity,
generalizability, and interpretive validity. The overall objective to address the threats is to enhance the
validity of the study by minimizing the bias.
However, the researchers ensure the validity for the result reproducibility under the systematic
review protocol as planned and executed in this paper and the assumptions made. Assumptions relate
to freelancer association models considered by researchers, keywords categories, and their
descriptive labels, and so on. However, improper or ambiguous use of terminologies by studied
research paper authors may beconsideredathreat. Details about each type of validity is as given under:
(a)
Descriptive Validity: The ability of the research study to accurately describe the gathered
information ensures descriptive validity. To handle descriptive validity, the data extraction form
was used (Appendix A) to accurately record the information, which was synthesized to populate
the conceptual schemas leading to meet the objectives of the study.
(b) Theoretical validity: Theoretical validity is the ability of the researchers to capture through the
systematic mapping study the information that they intended to capture [5]. The mistakes made
for the selection of the studies, extracting data from them, and finally accurately classifying
them results in outcomes that deviates from what researchers wish to investigate. To address
this concern, all theresearchersparticipatedintheplanningandexecutionofthemappingprotocol.
Randomchecks were also made to cross check the information extracted from the execution of
the mapping protocol. The process of the formulation and execution of the mapping protocol
was arranged as the series of the milestones. Each milestone is checked and agreed once they
are reached, before moving ahead towards bigger milestones. For example, before creating
a big structure schema for individual research questions, the sub schemas were created and
considered as small milestones. All the authors were involved in validating the milestones.
The randomefforts werealso madeinthelast to recheck all milestones to ensure bias free research
to the maximum possible extent. Any disagreements among the researchers were resolved using
consensus meetings.
(c)
Generalizability: The results of the mapping study are highly generalizable because the mapping
study had ensured the coverage of a broad research area for a longer time interval for all types of
diverse sized software companies.
(d) Interpretive validity: The ability of the researcher to accurately interpret the gathered data
without subjective judgement is called interpretive validity. In other words, the conclusion
drawn should be driven by the data gathered from the studies. Analysis of the data by multiple
researchers should result in similar interpretation of the data. The joint involvement of all
researchers in the formulation and execution of the mapping protocol helped to resolve issues
withsinglesubjectivejudgments. Resultsweredrawnconsideringtheagreementsamongmultiple
perspectives of the researchers which helped to ensure interpretive validity.
(e)
Repeatability is the ability of the mapping study to be repeated by another researcher which
yields similar results. The mapping study is executed using available guidelines and the mapping
protocol is specified in this paper to ensure reproducibility. The assumptions made during
formulation of the conceptual schemas and assignment of the studied research papers to these
categories are also mentioned. Provided the mapping conditions like search strings, inclusion and
Processes 2020, 8, 1215
21 of 25
exclusion criteria, and interpretation of the assumptions remains the same, the repeatability is
likely to prevail.
7. Conclusions and Future Work
The systematic mapping study resulted in identifying the valuable information about the research
trends in employing the freelancing team for undertaking the software development activities.
The valuable information is concluded by structuring it separately for each research question.
RQ1.Which software development process activities have involved the freelancers?
The distribution of the research efforts is non uniform across the software development life
cycle areas. The majority of studies focused on generic software development as a whole
rather on individual development activities. This limits the solutions addressing the freelancer
adoption across individual software development activities by overcoming the constraints which
are specific to the activities. Stated in other words, if the company requires freelancers in the
requirement prioritization phase then literature does not provide the solutions to manage the
outsourcing to the freelancers. The researchers had focused much on bringing solutions for
freelancer involvement for generic software development by addressing the various challenges
for the freelancer involvement (as identified in RQ 2), followed by validations in laboratory
settings (rather in a real world setting). The wide array of freelancers is available for undertaking
a variety of complex tasks but effectively managing them could bring value to the firm and hence
to its customers.
RQ2.Which Issues and challenges are associated with the freelancer involvement in the software
development process?
Various challenges and issues were reported including Collaboration and Coordination (33%),
DeveloperRecommendation(orselection)(19%), TeamFormulation(14%), TaskRecommendation
(allocation) (14%), Task Decomposition (11%), Privacy and Security (Confidentiality) (11%),
Budget Estimation (8%), Recognition (8%), Trust Issues (8%), Market Dynamism (6%),
Intellectual Property Issues (6%), Participation of Crowd Worker (6%), and Capacity
Utilization (3%). These challenges are interconnected, i.e., each challenge affects other challenges.
These interrelationships are usually ignored while designing solutions for freelancer involvement
in software development. In other words, solutions addressing one of more challenges
may be hindered by the challenges that are not under the consideration of the researchers.
A holistic approach is required which provides effective solutions addressing complex
interconnected challenges.
RQ3.How does freelancer supported software development research can be classified in terms of
research type?
The studies are usually validation-based approaches (72%) (solutions evaluated in
laboratory settings). This means that they still lack the evaluation in real world settings before
being actually put to use in industrial settings (unless the R&D department of the companies wish
to innovate them and adapt to their working context). The literature lacks empirical research,
which just account for 25% of total studies analyzed by the researchers. Empirical studies
should be undertaken to provide the research community with the research gaps in freelancer
driven software development and for the companies to gain access to the lessons learned by
other companies.
RQ4.Howdoesthe freelancer supported software development research evolved over the time?
The collaboration and coordination, developer recommendation, and task recommendation are
still the active challenges as faced by researchers. Since limited studies are reported in the
literature and this research area is in the initial phase, there is no sufficient evidence that effective
research solutions for freelancer driven software engineering exists today. The studies focused
Processes 2020, 8, 1215
22 of 25
on emerging areas like motivating freelancers (using gamifications), improving recognition
(example using blockchains), reducing technical debt, reaching product market fit in dynamic
markets under resource constraints etc. are missing from the literature. Overall, the studies focus
on broad challenges.
In future, it is expected that the research will suggest the efficient utilization of the freelancers in
software development of various application domains. The research will help to provide evidence and
effective solutions to employ freelancer teams in a cost-effective way.

In search of meaningful work on digital 
freelancing platforms: the case of design 
professionals
Ekaterina Nemkova , Pelin Demirel and Linda Baines
Growth of the platform economy has been accompanied by critiques 
of the fragmented, isolated and precarious nature of the employment 
it offers. Yet, little is known about how creative freelancers per
ceive the meaning of work on the platforms. Based on 40 interviews 
with freelancers, clients, platform owners and industry experts, this  
paper reveals that most freelancers are concerned about how operat
ing through the platform, and their dependence on it, is undermining 
the meaningfulness of their work. Freelancers find that the platforms 
are eroding both the manifest (i.e. monetary) and latent (i.e. non‐ 
monetary) meaning of their work although they are mostly con
cerned about the latent element of meaning. The analysis reveals that  
the small group of freelancers who pursue meaningful work and  
earn a sustainable income on platforms are those with strong  
entrepreneurial orientation.
Keywords: freelancing, meaningful work, platform economy, 
precarity, global labour, entrepreneurship.
Introduction
The number of freelancers participating in digital freelancing platforms1 has increased over 
the years to a point where most global platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk, 
Upwork and Freelancer.com boast tens of millions of active members (Pongratz, 2018). 
According to recent statistics, the use of platforms is growing globally by more than 25 per 
cent per year (Lehdonvirta, 2018). Although some of these platforms focus on digital mi
crowork where workers undertake small digital human‐computing tasks such as tagging 
images and classifying text into categories, others provide opportunities for more creative 
and complete work experiences, such as designing a company’s brand guidelines or logo, 
and programming a website (Bergvall‐Kåreborn and Howcroft, 2013). This paper focuses 
on creative professionals on digital freelancing platforms to examine the ‘meaningful 
work’ construct in the context of platform economy jobs.
Different applications of the platform economy2 have been described in a positive 
light as alleviating poverty (Hamari et al., 2016), empowering ordinary people through

entrepreneurship and offering upward mobility (Holtgrewe, 2014; Schor, 2016); as 
well as in a negative light as ‘neoliberalism on steroids’ (Murillo et al., 2017) and as 
undermining the rights of workers, causing millions to live with continuous worry and 
insecurity (BBC, 2017). While much has been written about the platform economy, this 
has tended to focus on microwork activities and little is known about how creative 
freelancers perceive the meaning of work on the platforms (Fieseler et al., 2019). Do 
creative freelancers find their work on the platforms more meaningful, empowering 
and liberating compared to alternative work options? Or do they find themselves stuck 
with non‐fulfilling and precarious work? In order to address these questions in this 
article, we develop an understanding of the prevailing work conditions in digital free
lancing platforms and workers’ perceptions of the meaning of their work.
Workers increasingly attach more significance to the meaning they attribute to work 
(Goins, 2015). In ethics literature, meaningful work is considered ‘a fundamental hu
man need’ (Yeoman, 2014: 235) while Marxian political economy emphasises the im
portance of work as the means to realise the creative potential of an individual (Marx, 
1977). Meaningful work in a holistic sense does not only meet people’s economic (con
sumption) needs, but also provides them with creativity and freedom to express them
selves in authentic ways (Spencer, 2015). Workers who are able to experience meaningful 
work by aligning their work with their own interests, skills, values and passions are 
claimed to also deliver a greater societal contribution through a deeper commitment to 
work (Duffy and Dik, 2013; Bailey and Madden, 2016). The creative workforce is par
ticularly focused on ‘meaningful work’ as it is central to derive satisfaction from work 
beyond the simple means of earning a living, as expressed by Huws (2010: 510):
The [creative] worker does not only care about the monetary reward but also about the work’s 
content (or intellectual property) which, even after it has been sold, may still be experienced as in 
some sense ‘owned’ – something of which it is possible to be proud.
Understanding meaningful work depends not only on the work itself, but also on the 
context in which that work takes place (Spencer, 2017). As the platform economy expands 
and the nature of work is unavoidably reframed, concerns grow over platform jobs erod
ing the meaningfulness of work that creative freelancers experience (Kalleberg and Dunn, 
2016). Characteristics of platform economy work such as the presence of fragmented tasks 
disconnected from the larger work project, rigid review and rating systems, and having to 
always be ‘online’ can be seen as detrimental to the meaningful work construct (De Peuter, 
2014; Kenney and Zysman, 2016; Schörpf et al., 2017; Lehdonvirta, 2018). Platform econ
omy workers lack power in their relationships with clients, opening up potential avenues 
of not only labour abuse and work intensification but also less meaningful work experi
ences (Fieseler et al., 2019). Yet, the burgeoning literature does not examine what constitutes 
meaning for creative workers in the platform economy, what detracts meaning for them in 
platform employment, and who is more or less likely to experience meaningful work in the 
digital freelancing platforms.
The paper’s contributions are twofold. First, it sheds light on work experiences on 
digital freelancing platforms where a wide variety of different creative tasks and differ
ent geographies are considered. This adds to a growing body of empirical literature on 
digital freelancing by providing evidence on more complex and creative digital work 
tasks in comparison to microwork. In particular, it provides insights into how freelanc
ers undertaking these tasks perceive meaning in the platform economy work. Second, 
the paper highlights how the platform economy mechanisms degrade different ele
ments of meaning and why some creative freelancers are able to cope with these mech
anism better than others. In doing so, the paper bridges scholarship on digital platforms, 
meaningful work and entrepreneurship/self‐employment to capture the complex na
ture of creative work practices on digital platforms. Based on the findings, it is argued 
that a small minority of freelancers remain resilient in the face of platform mechanisms 
that degrade meaningful work through their entrepreneurial orientation.
The paper proceeds with a section that summarises the background literature on 
meaningful work in the platform economy. The methodology employed in the study

is then presented, followed by findings and discussions. The conclusions section sums 
up the findings and highlights the contributions of the study.
Concepts of meaningful work
In 1963, Frankl wrote that one of the fundamental ways of discovering meaning in life 
is through creating a work or doing a deed. While a meaningful life can be derived 
from a variety of activities, many agree that work has a big role to play in it (Bunderson 
and Thompson, 2009; Duffy et al., 2011). Meaningful work can be characterised to have 
‘manifest’ and ‘latent’ meanings (Gill, 1999). The manifest meaning is associated with 
instrumental or strictly economic rewards, such as pay (‘means to an end’); whereas 
the latent meaning includes intrinsic rewards of autonomy, creativity, authenticity and 
external recognition among others. The latent meaning of work is often valued over 
instrumental rewards (Bailey and Madden, 2016), as it is argued that work performed 
solely for economic and career advancements is unlikely to provide a deep meaning 
(Bunderson and Thompson, 2009; Bailey and Madden, 2016).
Latent meaning arising from significant and purposeful work experiences—considered 
to be a ‘calling’ rather than ‘just a job’—was historically considered sufficient for work to 
be meaningful as people sacrificed their material well‐being in order to serve God or a 
higher power (Cohen et al., 2019). Indeed, Weber (1930) explains that calling meant re
sponding to God’s call to perform moral and socially valuable work which serves a pur
pose beyond the ‘self’. After the spiritual connotations greatly fell away over time, the 
meaning of calling evolved to reflect ‘a highly meaningful career that is used to help others 
in some fashion’ (Duffy and Dik, 2013: 429) and the meaning at work remained as the 
source of a person’s lifetime self‐identity. More recently, due to flexible market conditions, 
meaningful work is no longer as closely tied to self‐identity, and is instead seen as a crucial 
aspect of an individual’s life where the norm for meaningful work is flexibility and a drive 
for constant innovation (Bendassolli and Tateo, 2017).
The empirical literature on meaningful work emphasises that changing factors such 
as task design and work circumstances affect the meaning that individuals attribute to 
their work experiences (Lips‐Wiersma and Morris, 2009; May et al., 2014; Michaelson 
et al., 2014). Emergence and growth of the platform economy, along with the changing 
work relationships on the platforms, introduces important questions around whether 
and how meaningful work is experienced by a growing share of the creative workforce 
employed by these platforms. In particular, there are concerns about the erosion of 
meaning in work for platform economy workers, as discussed in the next section 
(Drahokoupil and Fabo, 2016).
Precarity in the platform economy and implications for meaningful work
Issues surrounding employment on the platform economy have been raised recently in 
the work and employment literature, including concerns about precarious employ
ment (Bergvall‐Kåreborn and Howcroft, 2013; Tweedie, 2013; Prosser, 2016; 
Sundararajan, 2016; Webster, 2016). Although precarity has long been a component of 
work circumstances in the labour market (Morgan et al., 2013)—especially for creative 
professionals (Florida, 2014)—the growth of the platform economy has intensified this 
in recent years (Webster, 2016). Digital freelancing platforms present a number of 
mechanisms that pave the way for potentially less meaningful work experiences for 
creative freelancers.
Firstly, due to the short‐term and the project‐based nature of the work relationships in 
the platform economy, employers (or ‘clients’ as more frequently referred to in these con
texts) have less reason to provide meaningful work to their employees. Likewise, plat
forms act solely as intermediaries, which create a marketplace for clients and freelancers 
and take a ‘neutral position’, assuming no responsibility to provide meaningful work to 
freelancers (Barnes et al., 2015; Kenney and Zysman, 2016; Graham et al., 2017b).

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License
Secondly, platforms accommodate highly standardised and commodified work that 
is often broken into small repetitive tasks not only for microworkers but also for crea
tive professionals (Bergvall‐Kåreborn and Howcroft, 2014; Graham et al., 2017b; 
Lehdonvirta, 2018). This alteration of job design, characterised by fragmented task 
identity (i.e. not being able to complete the full task), repetition (i.e. reduced creativity 
and reduced variety in the range of capabilities used by the worker), and lowered sig
nificance of work (i.e. not seeing the positive impact of one’s work on others), can un
dermine the meaningfulness of work experienced by digital freelancers on the 
platforms (Fried and Ferris, 1987; Michaelson et al., 2014).
Thirdly, many online freelancing platforms use rating and review systems that al
low clients to provide feedback and evaluate the freelancers with whom they work 
(Horton and Golden, 2015; Pongratz, 2018). These systems provide clients with the 
means to assess potential freelancers on the basis of their online reputation (Lin et al., 
2016; Schörpf et al., 2017) but can be detrimental to meaningful work experiences 
through limiting autonomy and creativity. Rating and review systems can act as signif
icant entry barriers for new entrants with no or few existing reviews and influence 
their work experiences negatively from the start. Additionally, freelancers are known 
to undertake all the actions necessary in order to avoid negative reviews as they face 
disproportionately unfavourable consequences (i.e. loss of business very quickly; 
Moreno and Terwiesch, 2014; Lin et al., 2016; Rosenblat et al., 2016; Tadelis, 2016; 
Borsenberger, 2017; Jin et al., 2017; Wood‐Doughty, 2018). In such a setting, rating and 
review systems act as disciplinary tools to control freelancers’ behaviour and work 
(Schörpf et al., 2017; Wood et al., 2019).
Finally, the increased competition levels on digital platforms can affect freelancers’ 
work experiences negatively due to work intensification. Freelancers from all over the 
globe greatly outnumber the clients on digital platforms, creating a hypercompetitive 
environment where freelancers often face having to accept lower remuneration, work 
on tasks that are not necessarily desirable and work long hours to stay competitive 
(Barnes et al., 2015; Pongratz, 2018). As a result, the choice and autonomy that freelanc
ers have over the jobs they accept and how much they charge are greatly limited while 
the outcome of their work is highly dependent on clients’ approval. Even though free
lancers in digital freelancing platforms do not have a line manager in the traditional 
sense, they must often conform strictly to their clients’ wishes in their work to ensure 
good ratings, and this reduces flexibility and autonomy in their work (Doody et al., 
2016). Fieseler et al. (2019) find that digital freelancers perceive their work as highly 
unfair across different dimensions (i.e. procedural, distributive and interactional fair
ness). Perceptions of unfairness, along with reduced bargaining power and autonomy, 
are likely to make it harder for digital freelancers to attain more meaningful work 
experiences.
While these platform mechanisms are very likely to re‐frame work experiences, to 
date the literature does not explore how the meaningfulness of work is affected. Many 
recent studies implicitly argue that the manifest meaning of work is eroded in a ‘race 
to the bottom’ in platforms (Graham et al., 2017a) but make less explicit postulations 
about if and how the latent meaning can be found.
Entrepreneurship in platform economy and meaningful work
Although it can be challenging for freelancers to experience meaningful work, digital 
freelancing platforms arguably provide a suitable work environment to some who are 
able to live the freelancer’s dream of doing what they like, working when and as much 
as they wish, as well as working on projects they choose (Sapsed et al., 2015). These 
experiences suggest that there is the potential for meaningful work on platforms, 
which we discuss next.
The platform economy boosts low‐risk ‘micro entrepreneurship’ that offers an alter
native to those previously constrained to traditional employment (Sundararajan, 2014). 
Indeed, entrepreneurial ideals of self‐reliance and flexibility are well diffused among

platform economy workers (De Peuter, 2014; Doody et al., 2016). While enterprising 
careers are not new to freelancers in traditional/non‐digital labour markets (Baines, 
1999; Granger et al., 1995; among others within the freelancing literature), recent years 
have seen an increased uptake of entrepreneurship (sometimes referred to as ‘forced 
entrepreneurship’) due to the rise of the platform economy (Scholz, 2016).
Following a long and inconclusive debate on who constitutes an ‘entrepreneur’—a 
business owner, innovator, risk taker, or self‐employed among other possible descriptors 
(Begley and Boyd, 1987; Carland et al., 1988; McKenzie et al., 2007)—the entrepreneur
ship literature often takes the route of focusing on the entrepreneurial disposition or 
entrepreneurial orientation of the individuals to avoid inconclusive discussions, given 
the overlaps and fuzzy boundaries between these different definitions (Walter and 
Heinrichs, 2016). Creativity, a greater need for control, strong desire for independence 
and autonomy, a greater risk‐taking propensity, proactivity and a greater ambiguity 
tolerance as well as a strong learning orientation are argued to characterise entrepre
neurs (Carland et al., 1988; Espíritu‐Olmos and Sastre‐Castillo, 2015). Even though 
workers on digital freelancing platforms are typically classified as self‐employed and 
perceived as entrepreneurs in a broad sense, a mixed level of entrepreneurial inten
tions and inclinations exist among them. Indeed, a large proportion of platform econ
omy workers consider their work as more akin to contract work and freelancing 
instead of business ownership (Sundararajan, 2014, 2016).
Our perspective is based on an understanding that what distinguishes entrepreneur
ial individuals from others is a desire or a vision to create a business (Coulson, 2012). 
Some see themselves ‘on ramp’ to starting an independent business using the plat
form; others have already successfully established online businesses. According to 
Doody et al. (2016: 864),
those hoping to maintain their incomes [in the platform economy] need to adopt an enterprising 
persona, as the capacity of workers to brand and sell themselves in this growing market for non
standard labor is now of utmost importance.
Parallels exist between some of the entrepreneurial characteristics and the founda
tions of meaningful work, in particular for autonomy. Autonomy, which can be de
f
ined as freedom of action (Lumpkin et al., 2009), is prevalent within the context of 
self‐employed entrepreneurs who declare freedom to make decisions and ‘control’ 
their destiny as important reasons for choosing self‐employment (Douglas and 
Shepherd, 2002). In the meaningful work literature, autonomy of work and control 
over one’s work choices are also considered to be a crucially important condition for 
meaningful work experiences (Bowie, 1998). Prior studies reflect that freelancers join 
digital platforms in search of autonomy and more flexibility over when, where and 
how to work and the projects and clients with whom they work (Abubakar and 
Shneikat, 2017; Graham et al., 2017a; Lehdonvirta, 2018; Wood et al., 2019). Nevertheless, 
the literature paid little attention to the importance of entrepreneurial orientation and 
desire to build a business for finding meaningful work on platforms.
This paper attempts to address this issue by firstly examining what constitutes 
‘meaningful work’ (Bowie, 1998; May et al., 2014) on digital freelancing platforms, 
what erodes meaning of work on platforms and whether entrepreneurial orientation 
can facilitate coping mechanisms to deal with the ‘downsides’ of platform employ
ment in the pursuit of meaningful work.
Data and methodology
In order to address our research questions, design professionals participating in digital 
freelancing platforms constituted the empirical focus of this paper. These designers 
undertake 2D or 3D design that can range from editing a less prominent aspect of a 
website or image to completing a more complex design project such as web design. 
Such variety in the tasks undertaken enables the study to explore if and where

meaningful work can be located in these platforms, and to identify the conditions 
where individuals are able to ascribe more meaning to their work.
This study is grounded in an interpretivist approach. As the study sought to acquire 
an in‐depth understanding of design freelancers’ subjective experience and perception 
of meaningful work on digital freelancing platforms, a qualitative research method 
using semi‐structured interviews was selected (Bryman, 2012; Barnes et al., 2015). The 
sample comprised freelancers, clients, platform owners and industry experts based in 
different parts of the world. Inclusion of different groups enabled a more holistic un
derstanding of the freelancer‐client working relationships, power dynamics on the 
platforms and success factors in the platform economy.
The sample was recruited through a combination of purposive sampling and snow
ball sampling; the approach accounted for the context and milieu in which potential 
participants were active (Kazmer and Xie, 2008). The potential participants among the 
freelancers were initially contacted via ‘Behance’, a professional social network for 
creatives. ‘Behance’ is a social media platform used to display artwork projects design
ers have completed in the past. One hundred and sixty‐six designers were contacted 
based on having active ‘Behance’ profiles (i.e. having posted a recent project within the 
last 30 days). During the initial contact they were informed about the study and asked 
if they were offering their services on one or more crowd employment platforms. 
Freelancers who confirmed that that they had offered their services or undertaken 
work on freelancing platforms were invited to participate in an interview. As the study 
sought to obtain a range of perspectives in terms of geographical spread and roles 
(Creswell and Miller, 2000), participants were invited to suggest clients or industry 
experts who might be interested in participating in the study, and platform owners 
were contacted directly through their websites. The sample (n = 40) comprised 26 free
lancers who came from 17 countries around the world, nine clients, two industry ex
perts and three platform owners (see Appendix 1).
To explore different perspectives on meaningful work on digital freelancing plat
forms, and to identify conditions for individuals to ascribe more meaning to their 
work, separate interview guides were designed and used for freelancers, clients, in
dustry experts and platform owners. Interview guides for freelancers focused on their 
general experience on the platforms, satisfaction levels, reasons for participation, ex
pectations from platform employment, ways of working and finding work, and rela
tionships with clients; guides for clients focused on the general experience on the 
platforms, the types of projects they post on the platforms, the ways they are looking 
for suitable freelancers and their working relationships with freelancers. Interview 
guides with platform owners focused on their views of the client‐freelancer relation
ship and the purpose, challenges and advantages of the platforms. Finally, interviews 
with the industry experts explored the overall dynamics of platform employment and 
the strategies for successful work relationships on platforms. Semi‐structured inter
views were conducted via Skype and lasted about one hour; they were recorded and 
transcribed. The data collection took place between June and September 2016, the data 
was anonymised and the pseudonyms were used to report the findings.
The data were analysed using template analysis, which is a form of thematic analysis that 
combines a flexible structured process in analysing the data to suit the needs of a particular 
study (Brooks et al., 2015). First‐order codes were developed based on the literature review, and 
additional codes were developed based on themes arising from the data. Two researchers 
coded the data to verify the analysis and ensure consistency in approach and interpretation. 
The data were interpreted iteratively, by reviewing the emerging themes, understanding what 
the data disclosed about the research questions, and considering the meaning of the data and 
how this compared with the main patterns and themes.
Where is the meaning on platforms?
It has been acknowledged that platforms have the potential to create both mean
ingful (good) and meaningless (bad) jobs (Kalleberg and Dunn, 2016). With this in

mind, we begin by elaborating on the essence of meaningful work for digital  
freelancers. Then, we explore the platform conditions that can increase precarity 
and lead to the lack of meaning for freelancers; this is followed by an exploration 
of the clients’ expectations about platforms. Finally, we explain how some freelanc
ers are able to overcome the disadvantages of platform employment through their 
entrepreneurial orientation.
Manifest versus latent meaning—I choose platforms because I want to be free
To start with, both types of meaning—manifest (i.e. monetary) and latent (i.e. beyond 
monetary)—were brought up by the interviewees in their reasons for joining the plat
forms. Some freelancers are mostly interested in monetary rewards for the work; and 
earnings constitute the only kind of meaning they seek on the platforms (‘means to 
making the ends meet’ instead of a ‘calling‐orientation’; Wrzesniewski, 2003; Visser, 
2016). These designers are usually based in developing countries and charge relatively 
low prices for their services ($5–$15 per hour). For them, platforms provide employ
ment opportunities; and they rarely mention concerns regarding any aspects of their 
work other than pay.
Many freelancing platforms position their social mission around this group of free
lancers who often lack employment opportunities elsewhere (e.g. see Samasource 
https ://www.samas ource.org/impact). One of the platform owners who took part in 
this study enthusiastically emphasised that their mission was to lift people out of pov
erty by ‘plugging’ them into the global labour market, and providing them with op
portunities to ‘help themselves’. In his opinion, providing monetary meaning to these 
freelancers made the platform’s operations more legitimate and ‘meaningful’.
Yet, most freelancers in our sample expressed their desire for ‘latent meaning’ in 
their work, beyond monetary meaning. Indeed, some freelancers reported that it is this 
latent meaning that attracts them to the platforms where they can gain a high degree 
of personal autonomy (i.e. the ability to make their own decisions) and experience au
thenticity (i.e. behaving consistently with one’s interests and values) to achieve profes
sional growth (Rosso et al., 2010).
There were some projects I had on [the platform] in which I was trying to work in my bed; the pro
jects were extremely interesting so I dedicated all my time to these projects. And it actually never 
happens to me in my local projects 
(Designer Kareem, Morocco).
Freelancers explained that the freedom of choice and autonomy on the platform al
low them to be authentic and true to their values—to be ‘real’. Being ‘real’ was only 
possible if one worked on the projects they are genuinely interested in and found space 
for professional growth. Such satisfaction in being ‘real’ is important for those in search 
of meaningful work. Several of the clients on the platforms note that they want the 
freelancers to be ‘human’, tell their ‘own story’ through their work, and be intrinsically 
motivated to work on the projects (Clients Jonathan, Edmond, Peter, Ashley); they 
want them to be ‘excited’ (Client Edmond) and ‘sincerely interested’ (Client Ashley) to 
produce better‐quality work.
Platforms also have the potential to create meaningful work through boosting crea
tivity (c.f. Cskikzentmihalyi, 2013). One of the platform owners recognised the variety 
of projects as a clear benefit of the platforms.
It is growing really fast and people love having the choice and variety they get on these platforms… 
What I hear from designers is that the more work they do, the more creative they get. So, we give 
them the work that can keep them in the creative zone. The more they produce, the better they 
produce 
(Platform owner David, UK/Global).

Autonomy, authenticity and creativity are necessary but not sufficient conditions for 
the work to have a latent meaning as the freelancers wish to see their work valued and 
appreciated by clients. This aspect of meaningful work is associated with task signifi
cance, which reflects a positive impact of one’s work on others (Fried and Ferris, 1987; 
Rosso et al., 2010). Clients’ feedback holds a lot of potential for designers to feel that 
their work is meaningful and appreciated (Graham et al., 2017a,2017b; Minter, 2017).
There are so many offers and from so many offers you just… someone picks you and you feel good! 
So for me [this platform] was mostly psychological; I mean it helped me to regain balance and con
f
idence in my skills 
(Designer Diana, Spain/Romania).
Although freelancers can experience autonomy, authenticity, creativity and task sig
nificance as a way to achieve meaningful work experiences, most freelancers high
lighted that their work is subject to very close control from the clients due to the 
systems incorporated in the platform structures (Schörpf et al., 2017). This will be ex
plored in the next section.
Power of clients and platforms– I will do anything, just don't rate me badly!
The majority of the interviewed freelancers expressed an awareness of their in
creased precarity on the platforms. Power inequality between freelancers and cli
ents, as well as being at the mercy of the platform and the review systems, were 
argued to intensify the pressures on freelancers and detract meaning from their 
work. While the emphasis was more on the loss of latent meaning instead of man
ifest meaning, it was clear that in the freelancers’ view the latent meaning cannot 
be achieved in absence of manifest meaning. It was notable that freelancers that 
expressed anguish about the loss of meaningful work on platforms were more 
likely to be from developed economies. They argued that both manifest and latent 
meaning were quickly disappearing for them on the platforms. They felt that their 
work is both underappreciated and underpaid.
You just don’t feel like you’re earning anything because you have spent hours on a big project and, 
if you don’t get much out of it, you just feel very discouraged 
(Designer Tomasz, UK/Poland).
Three important reasons that limited freelancers’ opportunities to undertake mean
ingful work came up during the interviews. Firstly, having to respond to proposals 
promptly—sometimes within minutes—to stand a chance of getting a ‘gig’. Having to 
deliver the jobs very quickly created constant time pressure that restricted creativity. 
Moreover, it often led to lower‐quality work and reduced job satisfaction.
You can get more unique things when you have more time because you kind of – you are more hard 
on yourself and have more time to work on it. But because [on the platform]… they only pay $100, 
I’m not going to spend more than a day or two on a logo… I work very fast in general, but when I 
worked in the studio I would make a lot, a lot, a lot of drafts and the bosses would like – would be 
very selective. And now I kind of stand behind what I make but I don’t know, if I was in a studio, 
that they would approve what I do 
(Designer Leah, Israel).
Creative workers need time and space to develop innovative ideas that can result in 
more meaningful work experiences (c.f. Cskikzentmihalyi, 2013). Yet, the abovemen
tioned pressures commonly lead many freelancers on digital platforms to lack both. 
Their work starts resembling ‘digital Taylorism’ (Lauder et al., 2008; Holtgrewe, 2014) 
and is a far cry from achieving one’s ‘dream job’ and self‐development (Sapsed et al., 
2015).

Secondly, most freelancers felt they had little power in the client‐freelancer relationship 
and that they lacked choice and control over their work. This exacerbated the feelings of 
being controlled as well as not being able to undertake meaningful work. According to 
many freelancers, the platforms and their evaluation mechanisms were the source of 
power inequality. Most freelancers cited the review and rating systems as taking away 
control, authenticity and creativity. As the rating and review systems replace traditional 
credibility measures (e.g. qualifications, employment references and personal recommen
dations), clients’ reviews can significantly influence freelancers’ future employability and 
therefore are used as disciplinary tools (Schörpf et al., 2017).
Freelancers reported that the fear of bad reviews often stops them from experiment
ing and applying for challenging jobs; therefore, restricting their choice, ability to grow 
and challenge themselves. Most freelancers discussed that the review systems limited 
their ability to navigate their client relationships freely.
I guess I’m a little scared to work on things that I don’t have a lot of experience in because I don’t 
want to get a bad review, because [the platform] works on the review system, so if you have bad 
reviews and then your work success percentage goes down it’s really hard to find new work. So I 
tend to stay in areas that I know that I have experience in, [so] that I can do a good job 
(Designer Leah, Israel).
One freelancer argued that clients used the review systems to ‘whip you to work for 
$1’ and she felt humiliated because she was ‘someone who graduated from a top de
sign school’ but was forced to work on the platforms and be treated in this way 
(Designer Nur, Turkey). As a result of her negative interactions with clients on the 
platform, this freelancer was considering removing herself from the platform and in
stead create illustrations to put on a website which pays per download of the product, 
with no interaction with clients. Her reasoning was ‘I deserve to be treated more re
spectfully and, if this is not possible on these platforms, I will find a solution that by
passes clients completely’. Clients acknowledged that review and ratings systems 
empowered them, as freelancers are ready to do ‘anything’ (e.g. work for free, refund 
the payment) in order to receive a five‐star review.
I almost feel bad paying them that amount for it but it sounds like they’re just willing to do any
thing just to get a good rating…. That’s happened multiple times to me where I’m not happy with 
something and they’ll say if you’re not happy with it they would rather refund you your money 
than to get anything less than a five‐star rating 
(Client Jonathan).
Third, freelancers felt that the meaning of their work was further reduced due to the 
platforms’ governing rules and reported feeling ‘on their own’ because platforms side 
with clients in the case of conflicts.
In nine out of 10 cases, disputes are ruled [in favour of] the client and not for the service provider 
and all of these biases are inside the policies, so it is really hard to defend your side 
(Designer Andrei, Bulgaria).
Moreover, most freelancers expressed concern over their future on the platforms as 
platforms could ‘pull the rug [from] under their feet’ (Industry expert Sam) at any time 
with a decision such as increasing their transaction fees or deciding to change the rules 
of engagement.
Oh well, there is the issue that they raised the transaction fee from 10 per cent to 20 per cent, which 
is really a lot…. I had to raise my hourly rate. I tried to explain that I have to pay 20 per cent to [the 
platform] but it’s hard 
(Designer Leah, Israel).
This intensely pressurised working environment led many of the freelancers in 
this study to believe that they were not working in a fair environment where their

work is respected. They felt highly concerned about the processes that detract 
meaning from their work on the platforms and disempowered them during the 
interactions with clients. There was a strong feeling that they are not in control of 
their freelancing careers. Freelancers frequently reported not having enough time 
and space to grow professionally, produce good‐quality work and exercise creativ
ity since the priority was always keeping up with the fast speed on the platform 
and obtaining new clients as well as ensuring their clients were satisfied enough to 
give a ‘five‐star rating’. As a result, they experienced a degradation of latent mean
ing in their work and the accompanying feelings of sadness, despair and anger to
wards the systems in place.
Differing client expectations on the platform—Wild Wild West
In contrast, the majority of clients in our sample felt that platforms were based on a 
system of fair competition which gave them an opportunity to pay the same amount of 
money to access much better talent, particularly with people based in developing 
economies: ‘it depends where they live too; somebody in India making $20 an hour 
versus somebody in the US making $20 an hour, it’s very different’ (Client Samantha). 
One platform owner summarised his views on globalisation as a macro‐trend that cre
ates work and meaning for some, while destroying it for others.
Some designers in the West tell you they are not happy with the designers in India and Indonesia 
doing the jobs at a fraction of the price they offer. I think that is borderline racist. This is a global 
economy and everyone participates 
(Platform owner David).
Some clients expressed a feeling of disappointment with the quality of labour on the 
platforms. These clients are interested in high‐quality work and ready to pay ‘extra’ for 
it in comparison to those who are looking for a ‘cheap solution’. This group of clients 
typically bypass freelancers in search of only manifest meaning (monetary rewards) as 
they believe such freelancers lack the commitment and interest to become long‐term 
‘business partners’ with whom to work on the platforms. They argued that the major
ity of freelancers on the platforms (‘about 80 per cent’—Client Edmond) were not de
livering high‐quality work and would not qualify as potential business partners. They 
complained about a lack of correlation between platform ratings and badges of excel
lence (e.g. ‘Top rated’, ‘Rising star’) and the level of work delivered. Therefore, ‘…
there’s a ton of search costs associated with finding high‐quality people on these plat
forms and it’s the wild wild West’ (Client Jonathan). As a result, they develop their 
own strategies to weed out poor‐quality freelancers.
I asked them some very specific graphic design questions. Questions that a graphic designer should 
be able to answer just straight off the bat…. ‘If you were designing a flyer for print, would you use 
400 or 500 dpi for your design?’ Now, both of those answers are wrong 
(Client Edmond).
When prompted to explain what they expect to see in a ‘high‐quality designer’ or a 
‘business partner’, these clients unanimously mentioned a deep interest and engage
ment in their problem and an intelligent way of providing solutions which add value, 
not just from a design point of view but in a more holistic business context. They were 
prepared to pay more for such designers who constitute a small group in our sample. 
These freelancers tend to be more prepared to sweep aside the potential ‘downsides’ of 
the platform economy and find meaning via platform employment. The next section 
sheds more light into how freelancers in this group are able create opportunities for 
meaningful work.

Entrepreneurial orientation in order to achieve meaningful work—I am here to 
solve a problem and build a business!
The findings reveal that designers who are able to cope with the constraints of the 
platform and experience meaningful work tend to express a strong entrepreneurial 
orientation. They were praised by clients for being ‘high‐quality’ professionals with 
‘top business skills’ (Client Mert). These freelancers present distinctly different strate
gies to pursue platform employment. Unlike the majority of the interviewees, who 
defined themselves as ‘freelancers’, entrepreneurial freelancers view themselves as 
‘business owners’, or on their way to establishing an independent business.
I have my own brand and I am trying to become a company. I’d like to build an A‐Team… A team 
with A‐players. I would like to start building my own apps. I need a developer; I need more people 
working for me. So that’s my plan for the future…. For me it’s like a challenge and I like challenges, 
looking for something new, yes, something different also. 
(Designer Juan, Bolivia).
Having an independent business was often seen as the facilitator for maintaining 
autonomy and control over their work. Being a business owner was also seen as the 
means to undertaking high‐quality creative work that feels more meaningful than any 
alternative work they could do elsewhere. These freelancers felt that they were in 
charge of their destiny thanks to the businesses they had set up fully or partially on the 
platforms. This autonomy facilitated authenticity and task significance they strongly 
craved to create meaning in work.
I can pick and choose exactly who I want to interact with and I don’t have any weaker staff or any
thing like that; it’s pretty much, what I call, sniper mentality, the ability to carve out my own sort of 
existence in space 
(Designer Max, UK).
I think it’s when you’re working for somebody else, you don’t really get the same recognition as 
when you’re self‐employed…. So I think it was always in my mind that at one point I would have 
my own business…. I think you get a different kind of satisfaction when you’re finishing a project 
(Designer Emma, UK).
The entrepreneurial freelancers in our sample put their focus on the ‘business side of 
things’ and on developing and using business skills instead of emphasising their de
sign work. This business focus is distinctly different from other interviewees who are 
focused on completing tasks with no future plans to start and grow a business.
I need to be aware of the business side of things because, at the end of the day, I’m not an artist, I’m 
here to solve a problem. I may use creativity. I may use my hands most of the time, and my imagi
nation, but, at the end of the day, I need to help them with their business problem 
(Designer Andrei, Bulgaria).
These freelancers aim to offer a deeper level of client engagement. Rather than taking the 
position of a contractor, they aim to foster a longer‐term relationship, showing interest in 
the client’s business and maintaining strong communications throughout. Positioning 
themselves as a ‘creative consultant’—someone who can provide solutions and advice—
rather than a designer who executes the work, these individuals aim to engage with the 
needs of their clients at a more holistic level and, as a result, gain the respect of their clients 
as well as claiming more room to express their autonomy and lead in the project.
Mainly you have to be like a consultant, not just a designer, because everyone has the designer de
gree or makes pretty drawings, but when they [clients] try and realise that you are a little bit further 
than that, you go a little bit further, it’s like they realise that they can’t own you, you know?… 
you’re going to be different to the other ones that just offer this commodity [design] 
(Designer Arnoll, France/Argentina).

I’m not a graphic designer… I don’t have any of the tools, so I really need somebody that knows 
what they’re doing… I mean, any time I’m looking for something I always like to say that I want to 
hire somebody that would be better at it than I would, so I want somebody that’s going to also teach 
me 
(Client Samantha).
Entrepreneurial freelancers emphasised the importance of self‐enhancement in pur
suit of meaningful work, in particular its creative elements. They often expressed the 
desire to acquire new technical design skills, develop their artistic abilities and become 
‘better at what they do’. They explained that they keep their knowledge and skills up 
to date, often using online tutorials and materials instead of more traditional training 
methods. Updating knowledge and skills is crucial for their ability to ‘pivot’, which 
emphasises the ability to smoothly change direction and move into different fields 
(Crilly, 2018). Pivoting not only helps them better engage with clients and have a more 
satisfactory business relationship, it also boosts the creative and innovative nature of 
their work, leading to more meaningful work experiences.
Sometimes it comes with the request from your client as well, so you might have started a project 
and realised that it is going well and everything is fine, however they want a particular style or they 
want a particular effect on their design, and sometimes because you don’t really want to turn away 
from it and just say, ‘Well, I can’t do it’, it’s up to you then to learn it and decide to go with it, and I 
guess that’s how I learned quite a lot 
(Designer Emma, UK).
By continuously enhancing their skills and pivoting as necessary, entrepreneurial 
freelancers feel confident that their work adds value to clients (task significance). They 
boldly state that they are much better than competitors/peers and they are not afraid 
of taking risks. These designers described how they are looking for challenges and 
push themselves as they believe that this allows them to improve the quality of their 
work and create new experiences. Undertaking different projects is perceived to pro
vide opportunities to develop skills and to enhance the task significance of what they 
do.
Finally, entrepreneurial freelancers expressed a strong awareness of the intense 
competition on the platforms but this was not seen negatively, describing competition 
as a welcome ‘fight’. The metaphor they use to describe themselves is akin to a ‘lonely 
warrior’ (Designer Petras, Latvia). For them, the ability to compete and eventually ‘win 
a gig’ adds meaning to their work rather than detracting from it.
So it’s a competition; you have a whole range of prices there and a whole set of skills and quality. 
But when you are selected, it’s like, ‘Oh, yes!!! I beat all these guys!’ It’s a really good thing 
(Designer Juan, Bolivia).
Conclusions
The paper makes important contributions to the literature on digital platform employ
ment by exploring the concept of meaningful work for creative freelancers. It offers 
insights on what constitutes meaningful work for designers on digital platforms and 
which processes detract meaning from their work. Most freelancers that took part in 
this study were found to be looking for latent meaning in their platform work through 
autonomy, authenticity, creativity and appreciation from clients. However, many 
faced degradation of latent meaning due to platform specific factors. They viewed the 
platform environment as unfair mainly due to the power inequality in freelancer‐client 
relationships and the strict review and rating systems embedded in platforms. While 
the review and rating systems are intended to reduce information asymmetries by 
differentiating ‘good’ clients and freelancers, our findings revealed that they often

detract the meaning of work for freelancers leading to feelings of disempowerment 
and loss of control over one’s career.
The findings reveal that entrepreneurial orientation, that characterises a small group 
of the freelancers in this study, plays an important role in achieving meaningful work 
on digital platforms. It enables freelancers to experience both latent and manifest mean
ing. Even though connections between entrepreneurial orientation of the self‐em
ployed and their satisfaction with their work exist in the entrepreneurship literature 
(Binder and Coad, 2013), these connections are new to the platform economy litera
ture. Entrepreneurial freelancers position themselves as ‘business owners’ on the plat
form and business ownership is seen as a way to stay in control of their careers. These 
freelancers offer high levels of engagement to clients and sophisticated solutions to 
business problems rather than purely executing the given tasks. They continuously 
invest in their self‐development and are not afraid to step out of their comfort zone to 
take on new challenging projects. They also welcome the highly competitive environ
ment of the platforms and feel that they thrive by differentiating themselves from the 
rest of the crowd through unique skills.
While entrepreneurial orientation offers a feasible avenue to meaningful work on 
digital platforms, it should be considered in the context of broader societal and eco
nomic dynamics. Recently, a ‘glorification’ of entrepreneurship is common in media 
and academic curricula based on the premise of innovation hubs thriving on venture 
capital investment; and entrepreneurs developing high‐growth businesses and becom
ing young billionaires. Nevertheless, it is often forgotten that this is not a holistic rep
resentation of entrepreneurship. In reality, over 50 per cent of entrepreneurial ventures 
fail within the first four years (Roper and Hart, 2018) and entrepreneurship is associ
ated with high levels of precarity and ambiguity (Nemkova, 2017). Hence, it cannot be 
imposed on all creative freelancers. In reality the reasons for joining the platforms 
might be associated with ‘push’ or ‘pull’ factors (Kautonen et al., 2010) and affect the 
strategies freelancers choose to pursue. ‘Liberation from career and employment’ 
(Scholz, 2016: 18) on the platforms may be appealing for freelancers who a priori have 
a strong entrepreneurial orientation, but could be equally daunting for many others. 
Solely relying on entrepreneurial orientation to retain meaningful work on the plat
forms could be unsustainable proposition as platforms growingly evolve into free
lancer versions of capitalism with even more intense competition (crowd‐based 
capitalism; Sundararajan, 2016). Improved platform design, particularly in relation to 
the review and rating systems and client‐freelancer interactions, is crucial to sustain 
meaningful work as platform jobs increase in number.
