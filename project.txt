## **2.5 System Design Approaches**

**Purpose:**

* Explore methods for building scalable, maintainable platforms.

**What to include:**

* Agile methodology and sprints for development.
* Component-based architecture for React.
* Separation of concerns in frontend/backend.
* Database design: MongoDB schema design, normalization, indexing.

**Tip:** Include diagrams (ER diagrams, architecture diagrams).

## **2.7 Gaps in Existing Work**

**Purpose:**

* Identify what previous research/platforms lacked.

**What to include:**

* Lack of integrated tools (e.g., milestone tracking + real-time chat + escrow payments).
* Insufficient user feedback mechanisms.
* Scalability or performance limitations.
* Security gaps (fraud prevention, privacy concerns).

**Tip:** This sets the stage for your **research contribution**.

---

## **2.8 Summary**

**Purpose:**

* Summarize key findings from the literature review.

**What to include:**

* Major themes: user experience, technology choices, security, and performance.
* Reiterate gaps in existing platforms.
* Highlight how your project addresses these gaps.

**Tip:** Make this paragraph concise but clearly link **reviewed literature → research problem → TalentHive solution**.

---

## **2.9 Literature Review Table (Summary of Related Works)**

**Purpose:**

* Provide a quick reference of reviewed studies.

**What to include:**

* Columns like:

  1. Author(s) & Year
  2. Title / Study
  3. Methodology
  4. Key Findings
  5. Relevance to TalentHive

**Tip:** This is often a single table summarizing 4–10 key studies.
