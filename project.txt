# **Chapter 2: Literature Review – Guide**

## **2.1 Introduction**

**Purpose:**

* Briefly introduce the chapter.
* Explain why a literature review is important for your study.

**What to include:**

* Context for your research: e.g., growth of the freelancing economy, challenges freelancers face, the rise of platforms like Fiverr, Upwork, and TaskRabbit.
* Objective of the chapter: to explore prior research and technologies relevant to freelancing platforms and modern web applications.
* Connect to your project: why understanding this literature helps you design **TalentHive**.

**Tip:** Keep it concise, around 2–3 paragraphs.

## **2.2 Theoretical Framework**

**Purpose:**

* Ground your project in existing theories or frameworks.

**What to include:**

* Relevant software engineering principles: Agile, User-Centered Design, MVC architecture, MERN stack principles.
* Theoretical foundations of online freelancing platforms:

  * How trust, reputation, and payment security influence platform adoption.
  * Algorithmic bias in freelancer selection (cite Hannák et al., 2017; Chen & Liu, 2023).

**Tip:** Use diagrams or tables to illustrate relationships between theories and your project if needed.

---

## **2.3 Related Work on Freelancing Platforms**

**Purpose:**

* Discuss previous studies/projects that developed or analyzed freelancing platforms.

**What to include:**

* Research on platform features: secure payments, milestone tracking, real-time communication.
* Studies on challenges: bias in freelancer selection, usability issues, payment disputes.
* Examples of platform analysis: TaskRabbit, Fiverr, Upwork.

**Tip:** For each study, summarize:

1. The aim of the study
2. Methodology
3. Key findings
4. Relevance to your project

## **2.4 Related Work on Web Technologies**

**Purpose:**

* Review literature on the technologies you used (React, Node.js, TypeScript, Material-UI, Redux, Socket.io, Stripe).

**What to include:**

* Frontend: React, Material-UI, Redux Toolkit.
* Backend: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, REST APIs.
* Real-time features: WebSockets, Socket.io.
* Payment integration: Stripe, secure transaction handling.

**Tip:** Focus on papers, documentation, and credible sources (journals, books, GitHub repos). Mention **why each tech is suitable for your project**.

---

## **2.5 System Design Approaches**

**Purpose:**

* Explore methods for building scalable, maintainable platforms.

**What to include:**

* Agile methodology and sprints for development.
* Component-based architecture for React.
* Separation of concerns in frontend/backend.
* Database design: MongoDB schema design, normalization, indexing.

**Tip:** Include diagrams (ER diagrams, architecture diagrams).

---

## **2.6 Security and Performance Considerations**

**Purpose:**

* Explore literature on web app security and performance.

**What to include:**

* OWASP Top 10 security risks and mitigation.
* Payment security protocols (PCI-DSS).
* Performance best practices: load balancing, caching, optimized database queries.

**Tip:** Link this back to your project: **TalentHive implements secure and performant solutions**.

---

## **2.7 Gaps in Existing Work**

**Purpose:**

* Identify what previous research/platforms lacked.

**What to include:**

* Lack of integrated tools (e.g., milestone tracking + real-time chat + escrow payments).
* Insufficient user feedback mechanisms.
* Scalability or performance limitations.
* Security gaps (fraud prevention, privacy concerns).

**Tip:** This sets the stage for your **research contribution**.

---

## **2.8 Summary**

**Purpose:**

* Summarize key findings from the literature review.

**What to include:**

* Major themes: user experience, technology choices, security, and performance.
* Reiterate gaps in existing platforms.
* Highlight how your project addresses these gaps.

**Tip:** Make this paragraph concise but clearly link **reviewed literature → research problem → TalentHive solution**.

---

## **2.9 Literature Review Table (Summary of Related Works)**

**Purpose:**

* Provide a quick reference of reviewed studies.

**What to include:**

* Columns like:

  1. Author(s) & Year
  2. Title / Study
  3. Methodology
  4. Key Findings
  5. Relevance to TalentHive

**Tip:** This is often a single table summarizing 4–10 key studies.

Task:
Carefully read the provided chapter content (Summary, Conclusion, Limitation, and Recommendation section of my Final Year Project).

Context:
This project follows the SWE4600 Final Year Project Guide by Maryam Ibrahim Mukhtar, which requires the final chapter to contain ONLY the following sections:

Summary

Conclusion

Limitation

Recommendation

Instructions:

Read the entire chapter text thoroughly.

Ignore all numbering and subsection titles used in the document.

Analyze whether the content complies with the SWE4600 guideline structure and expectations.

Map the existing content into the four required sections:

Summary: Paragraph summaries of all previous chapters

Conclusion: Project overview, problem statement, methodology, and key results/functionalities

Limitation: Features or capabilities that should exist but are not implemented

Recommendation: Future enhancements and areas for expansion

Identify:

Content that fits correctly under each required section

Content that is repetitive, excessive, or unnecessary for SWE4600 marking

Provide:

Clear guidance on what to merge, compress, or remove

Suggestions on how to restructure the chapter to fully comply with SWE4600 without losing marks

Do NOT rewrite the chapter fully unless explicitly instructed.

Focus strictly on academic compliance, examiner expectations, and grading safety, not journal-style writing.

Goal:
Ensure the final chapter is fully compliant with SWE4600 requirements, concise, examiner-friendly, and optimized for maximum marks.
